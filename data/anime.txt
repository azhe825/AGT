In the middle of The Dark Tournament Yusuke Urameshi gets to fully inherit Genkai s power of the Spirit Wave by absorbing a ball of energy from her However this process turns into an excruciating trial for Yusuke almost killing him and keeping him doubled over in extreme pain for a long period of time so much so that his Spirit Animal Poo is also in pain and flies to him to try to help My question is why is it such a painful procedure to learn and absorb this power >>> yu-yu-hakusho

Is there any particular software or software family specifically designed for making anime Are they drawing all the frames of motion scenes or does a software automatically generate them For example consider a soccer player kicking a football Let the duration of the scene be seconds and let the frame rate of the video be fps that makes frames in that scene Do they patiently draw all those frames manually for that scene which takes only half a second >>> anime-production
In several episodes of DB Z and DB GT it is said that using SSJ form is very tiresome to the user and works off energy in a matter of moments compared to being in SSJ enhanced mystic etc However when DB GT rolls around being in SSJ form while still tiresome as all other enhanced forms are doesn t seem to put as much strain on the user nor does it have a significant time restraint as SSJ seems to portray Is there a distinct reason in this in terms of power draw or how the body handles the transformation or is this perhaps something overlooked when GT was created >>> dragon-ball dragon-ball-gt
Edo Tensei is a technique to revive the dead and bind their souls into living bodies However after releasing the technique all of the dead should get back into being dead How can Madara still stick around even after the Edo Tensei had been ended I am not sure if it was something that we needed to think about and figure out by ourselves or is it yet to be revealed >>> naruto

It seems as though a lot of anime go through a cycle where they put out a series that seems to be fairly popular but it ends far before the manga storyline does Obviously a big push for anime is to get people to buy the manga but if the series was turning a profit it s tough to imagine from my American viewpoint anyway that they would abandon the series when it s already going well and could easily continue proven popularity voice actors lined up storyline set etc Is there an overarching reason Do many anime not turn a profit >>> anime-production
There are a few places in Mobile Suit Gundam Seed where Kira Yamato faces certain death is presumed dead by all the other characters then miraculously reappears in a later episode I m curious about one particular incident for now His duel with Athrun and the Aegis Athrun sets the Aegis to self destruct attaches it to Kira s suit and bails out to avoid the explosion Kira is apparently trapped in the deadly blast though Assuming he s not cloned or something like that which the humans amp Coordinators of Seed almost certainly have the technology to do he somehow managed to survive and escape from that situation How did Kira survive when the Aegis self destructed at point blank range to his own mobile suit >>> mobile-suit-gundam-seed

I m kind of fan of time travel stories so I got a little disappointed with Steins Gate According to Wikipedia there are different rules Mutable Timelines Immutable Timelines and Alternate Timelines When they explained timelines in the show I got the idea of the timelines being alternate but then we got all of this alpha beta timeline and that goes more with the immutable timelines with some alternate difficult to reach timelines And at the end Okabe couldn t change the beta timeline except if he cheated himself which would make the timeline mutable So did the script writers just cherry picked things as they felt it could add more drama for example I was telling myself all the time if Kurisu dies in timeline beta and Mayuri dies in timeline alpha wouldn t the solution be going to timeline Gamma Am I missing something >>> steins-gate
As anyone who has seen Lucky Star will remember most of the references to other anime and manga are censored The most obvious examples of this are references to Gundam or Sgt Frog both of which are notably Sunrise shows Presumably this is done to avoid KyoAni getting sued This also explains why references to Haruhi and Full Metal Panic weren t censored as far as I remember Interestingly these instances of censorship probably could have been removed in the English release since it was licensed by Bandai but I don t know if they actually were so this question might only apply to the Japanese version However there are still a few cases of references which weren t censored despite no obvious connection between the Lucky Star team and the source The one that immediately comes to mind is To Heart which is referenced several times To Heart is associated with VN studio Leaf as well as animation studios Oriental Light and Magic and AIC neither of which have anything to do with Lucky Star KyoAni and Kadokawa I can t find any connections between them but of course that could be oversight on my part and I didn t check all of the individual staff members Is there some connection that I missed Barring that what sort of policy would a studio typically use for references like this Would they try to obtain permission for all of the references or just bleep the ones that seem risky to them >>> lucky-star

If you ve seen much anime you re familiar with the male character getting a bloody nose when he gets sexually excited For example Master Roshi Dragon Ball and Umino Iruka Naruto However when I mentioned this to a Japanese person someone who was not a big anime viewer she was confused and adamant that a bloody nose would normally just mean that the person was excited in general and it would not necessarily have anything to do with sexual excitement This could and seems likely to be true for Japanese day to day real life but very different in anime where the connection to libido seems very clear Is there someone that can explain this difference Is the bloody nose in anime just used to signify excitement and it just happens to often always be sexual excitement because of the plot Or is it supposed to be just understood how a bloody nose is interpreted in anime is different from normal life >>> tropes
I understand that one of them is actually the other And firstly we are led to believe that Vincent is Ergo But toward the end of the show we discover something that I am not sure of its meaning Ergo created Vincent to run away from himself Also in the beginning when Vincent turns into Ergo he loses control and doesn t remember Later on he starts to control him but at the same time he talks with him So basically I don t actually understand which came first Is it Vincent Law that is Ergo Proxy Or is it the other way around Or are they actually two different selves that reside in the same body >>> ergo-proxy
It was said that when a Shinigami saves a human with his Death Note that Shinigami dies and his remaining life span is transferred to the human he saved But imagine the following situation a Shinigami has accumulated years of lifespan by killing a lot of humans That Shinigami then kills someone for a human to save his life and dies Does that mean the human would gain years to his lifespan >>> death-note

At his current state how could Madara possibly be defeated Any physical attack Taijutsu would be easily deflected by either The Susano o The Gunbai war fan which proved to easily negate a Bijuudama Shinra Tensei which wasn t seen yet but we have to assume he s capable of it And I m not even starting to talk about the Rikudo mode Any non physical attack would be easily absorbed by the Preta Rinnegan path There aren t m any ultra powerful genjutsu ninja who can hope to trap him in a genjutsu for more than seconds And in the offshoot that something does hurt him he d just regenerate He s a zombie What weakness does Madara have that could be exploited to harm him They d have to damage him badly to hope for a seal >>> naruto
Detective Conan is a notoriously long running series it s been running for like fifteen years and hundreds of cases have been solved Conan has made friends received upgraded technology over time cell phones and has generally kept up with its audience Yet logically time in universe must have passed and Shinichi s continued absence should be more notable than it is if he s been gone for more than a year How much time has passed currently in the Meitantei Conan universe >>> detective-conan

At the start of the Bleach manga Rukia stabs Ichigo in the heart with her zanpakutoh in order to give him her shinigami powers which allows him to protect his family from the Hollow From then Ichigo possesses a sealed zanpakutoh that he uses alongside Rukia in a gigai to fight Hollows around Karakura Later Rukia is returned to Seireitei and regains her shinigami powers which robs Ichigo of his This implies that Ichigo had borrowed his powers from Rukia for the run of what is usually called The Karakura Arc This is further supported when Ichigo gains his own zanpakutoh Zangetsu and his sword is unsealed rather than in its more benign state Because Ichigo is borrowing Rukia s spirit powers and because Zangetsu s form appears to be more volatile and less prone to remaining sealed Is the first zanpakutoh that Ichigo carries with him Sode no Shiraiyuki Rukia s zanpakutoh I m going to request scans of manga panels to back up your answer for this question >>> bleach

Alchemy in Full Metal Alchemist is based on the concept of one needs to provide materials of equal value compared to the thing one want to create equivalent exchange But how does it exactly work Can this amount of required materials be calculated by the alchemist If so how Are there some sort of lookup tables Or does one need to guess and provides something of more value to be on the safe side If so can one become a more skilled alchemist by experience of successful guesses Also different alchemists might have different specialized skills How does that work For the guessing part I can imagine that one have a preference for certain kinds of alchemy and thus gain experience with a specialized skill Edit Madara Uchiha s answer suggests that there are always materials required I was also wondering about the situation where this is not the case and the alchemist was successful none the less For example In the end Edward trades his alchemy skill in exchange for returning Alphonse s body to him >>> fullmetal-alchemist

At the ending of Code Geass R the last scene showed someone whose face wasn t showed riding a horse pulling cart with CC I believe that it is indeed Lelouch who was previously stabbed by Suzaku wearing Zero s uniform as part of their Code Zero plan to free Elevens and that he had gained immortality because of his frequent usage of his Geass Lelouch s Geass first leveled up the episode when he accidentally ordered his sister Euphemia to kill all Elevens Then his father King Charles was beaten by him and I m thinking that King Charles immortality was transferred to him If that person was really Lelouch then has he already gained immortality by that time >>> code-geass

In Ranma it s made obvious that Saotome Ranma speaks in a very casual and informal way but when I played a particular sound bite for some people who speak Japanese but who were not familiar with the anime both of them seemed to think that the sound bite was from someone playing a member of the Yakuza Does Ranma really speak with such a provocative accent in general or did I pick a sound bite that just could happen to sound like that It s probably not critical to the question but the bit I played in case you re curious was from the Lambada Ranma da song off of one of the soundtracks where he says omee kawaiku nee n da yo >>> ranma

In bleach manga Ichigo finally meets Rukia in her tower well in fact on the bridge right after Byakuya easily defeats Ganjyu and Ukitake stops him from finishing Ganjyu off However when Ichigo tries to fight Byakuya Yoruichi hits him in the stomach and runs carrying Ichigo away A little later in chapter when Ichigo complains about it she says that he had no chance of surviving that fight and that no one could have survived a fight against Byakuya While I have no doubts that Ichigo in his condition was no match for Byakuya that phrase still confuses me I can also understand why Yoruichi thinks she would not be able to do it since she has been in the cat form for a long time and she mentions that she had gone a lot weaker However there was still Ukitake on the bridge as well and since we know he s a kind man it is safe to assume that he would try to stop Byakuya from killing people as he did for Ganjyu So did Yoruichi imply that he is weaker than Byakuya and had no chance of surviving a fight with him either Wouldn t that be really arguable >>> bleach
Elfen Lied Erufen Rto has a rather confusing plot and setting in the anime version alone the bits of the setting which I glimpsed from discussions about it hint at the original manga being even more complex in the relationship department between the characters and organisations It doesn t help that the manga wasn t finished by the time the anime was produced which very likely leads to inconsistencies between the two with material which so heavily relies on uncovering secrets to drive its story forward How does the plot as opposed to superficial details like location or hair colour differ between the anime and manga then >>> elfen-lied

Well the title says it I ask this because supposedly Hyuuga and Uchiha are descendants of the Rikudou s eldest son at least I am under that impression In that way does the Byakugan have any other special techniques that can be awakened such as Tsukuyomi Susano o and Amaterasu in the Sharingan and can it ultimately awaken the Rinnegan So far we have not seen techniques that derive from the Byakugan itself but rather techniques that are possible because of it the whole Hyuuga fighting style comes from the use of Byakugan but it is not related to it in the same way that every Mangekyou technique is related to the Sharingan They were only able to develop and use it properly due to them having the Byakugan but again it does not relate to it in the same way the Mangekyou relates to the Sharingan To sum up Is it possible for a Byakugan user to awaken a Rinnegan >>> naruto

Mahou Sensei Negima is a manga by Akamatsu Ken which has had an anime and live action adaptation of the same name There is also another manga called Negima Neo by Fujima Takuya which was made into an anime titled Negima Wikipedia says that Fujima is the author and Akamatsu merely provided guidance MAL however credits Akamatsu as a story author along with Fujima Is there any official statement on Akamatsu s role in Negima Neo I mostly want to know if he played a major role in its creation or just basically made sure Fujima didn t completely ruin his series and or its reputation >>> mangaka negima ken-akamatsu
Spirited Away borrows a lot of its side characters from various Japanese legends although many are also original One of the most mysterious such characters is No Face who is perhaps slightly antagonistic and comes off as a spirit of greed or something to that effect The concept for No Face is very unique with a collection of strange powers that I don t know of in any other mythological spirit suggesting to me that he might be a unique creation of Miyazaki Are there any comments by Miyazaki on the origin of No Face Barring that is there a clear origin in some Japanese mythology or is he an original creation >>> spirited-away
During the chunin exam when Lee fights Gaara Kakashi says that as you open more gates the risk of death rises Well when Guy fights Kisame Guy has already opened several gates up to before the final attack and they have been open for quite a lot of time relatively before the seventh gate is opened And of course as he opens more gates with his stamina rate supposedly decreasing exponentially I m pretty sure he was supposed to be pretty exhausted But still when he opened the seventh gate he still had enough time to talk and stop Kisame from escaping Shouldn t this be too much for him >>> naruto
Were they built by traditional means as they would ve been in our world Were they created via some sort of ninjutsu that shaped the rocks that were there Or was it erected by some sort of Doton jutsu like some Doryuu Heki I am not sure if there is some canonical answer to this but I d like to hear your thoughts >>> naruto
The title says it all but I ll elaborate Initially we see techniques derived from a single chakra element Katon Doton Suiton Fuuton and Raiton These are the most common since usually a ninja can master only one chakra nature since normally ninjas tend to have an affiliation with only one chakra nature Later we discover these can be combined in a number of ways creating new elements Mokuton Doton Suiton Ranton Raiton Suiton Youton Katon Doton among several others From what I understand these are usually transmitted as a Kekkei Genkai But I believe they can also be created by the combinations of the elements by ninja who didn t inherit it from other generations correct me if I m wrong These are not uncommon but less frequent than the ones above there are ninja who can master and possess affiliation to more than one chakra nature Sasuke comes to mind since he can master both Katon and Raiton Katon is his clan s natural affiliation and he mastered Raiton too However I don t remember if he has ever combined the both of them Even later we find about combinations of even more elements by ninja who can master several elements such as Muu Nidaime Tsuchikage and Oonoki Sandaime Tsuchikage who can combine Katon Doton and Fuuton to create Jinton These are called Kekkei Touta I don t know if they can also be transmitted through Kekkei Genkai or if they can only be taught They are even rarer than the ones above since ninja can rarely master or be naturally affiliated to more than two chakra natures Terumii Mei the Godaime Mizukage can also master Doton Katon and Suiton but I don t think she ever combines more than two at each time My questions are Are combinations of chakra natures taught or only transmitted by Kekkei Genkai or both Are combinations of more than three chakra natures possible And the above question created a new one for me Can a ninja master more than three chakra natures I think Kakashi does but I am not quite sure about this >>> naruto
In Naruto there is a group of abilities called Kekkei Genkai They are told to be genetic abilities which are usually passed down genetically within specific clans Notably the eye techniques Djutsu such as sharingan are also a subset of those How did those abilities first appear Did they appear naturally or were they made on porpuse as a result of experiments >>> naruto

In Steins Gate there is much ado about the Divergence Number of the current world line But if I am remembering correctly the meter Kyouma made carries is given shows the difference between the current world line and the previous onewhich I understood to be the one Okabe was in immediately before his last time jump Does the Divergence Number work relative to the last time jumporiginating world line or relative to the world line where it was constructed the world line where SERN maintains a dystopia >>> steins-gate
I ll make a spoiler block of it all since this can be a spoiler to anyone who hasn t seen read the Pain and the Five Kage Summit arcs After the Pain attack on Konoha Tsunade exhausted her power and Danzo was nominated as Rokudaime Hokage This lasted for a very short period Danzo died fighting Sasuke and Tsunade soon recovered and was once again appointed Hokage So next will should come the Rokudaime again and Danzo should be ignored or should we move on to the Shichidaime Nanadaime not sure about this Hokage I ask this because some people and sites consider Danzo only a temporary Hokage in this logic we re still missing the th so the next should be it However something similar has happened with the succession from rd Hiruzen to th Minato and back to rd and later came Tsunade the th From this point of view the next to succeed should be the seventh Does anyone have any thoughts on this >>> naruto
The most obvious answer everyone over the internet is giving to that question is Because anime s run much faster compared to manga s so they need to put fillers in order to slow Anime series But that can t be all the reason for example consider One Piece The show is going on for more than episodes and less than is fillers And compare that to Naruto the show has almost same number of episodes original and shippuuden combined but almost of it s episodes are fillers Needless to say manga is far ahead in Naruto series that they won t be able to catch up even if they produce episodes without any fillers >>> anime-production
At the end of each Cowboy Bebop there is a phrase or a title card as the Cowboy Bebop Wiki calls them In most of the sessions the phrase reads See You space cowboy However there are some variations Session Easy Come Easy Go It is most likely a reference to how easy it is to win and lose money in a casino since this episode takes place in one Session The End I actually don t know if this is a reference or simply a classic The End Session To Be Continued It simply states the fact that this episode is a Part and the story is to be continued in the next session Session Do You Have a comrade It is a reference to the relationship that Gren had with Vicious and the fact that Spike helps him in the end Session Sleeping Beast It is a reference to Sleeping Beauty since Faye was asleep too preserved in a cryogenic state But I am not sure about the Beast part Session Life is but a dream Is a reference to the events that take place during the episode namely their hallucinations Session See You Space Samurai It is a reference to Andy s transformation from cowboy to samurai in the end of the episode Session None Don t know if this even needs to have a reason Session See You Cowgirl Someday Somewhere It is a reference to Ed and Ein parting from the rest of the crew Session To Be Continued Again simply a reference to the fact that this episode is a Part and the story is to be continued in the next session Session You re gonna carry that weight So what is the meaning of such a phrase at the end of the last session Does the author have some message that he wants to pass with this phrase Or is it simply a reference to the eponymous Beatles song >>> cowboy-bebop symbolism

I can kind of handwave or fanwank the origin of things like the exasperated faceplant or the vein popping out when a character is comedic angry and even the trope of Japanese flag fans coming out when people want to cheer on their comrades but how did the sweatdrop come to characterize the feeling of sort of embarrassed contrition I can t come up with anything logical just based on speculation Is this an outgrowth of the manzai tradition with the tsukkomi and boke characters >>> tropes anime-history
In the second season of Darker than black Darker than Black Ryuusei no Gemini Hei mysteriously loses his contractor powers somewhere in the middle of the season In the beginning of the anime we can clearly see that Hei still has his contractor powers since he uses them in a fight in episode However in later episodes it is revealed by some of the characters that Hei s powers are completely lost and he is but an ordinary human well a well trained human at least So what was the reason for Hei losing all of his contractor power out of sudden and without being noticed >>> darker-than-black

When I watched The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya on DVD the episodes were shown out of order It was somewhat funny since in the previews Haruhi and Kyon argue about which episode number comes next but other than that I didn t see the point of it It didn t have interwoven plot threads or any in universe reason to be shown out of order It looks like in other releases the episodes were arranged in chronological order so it must not have been essential to the viewing of the series Put simply Why did The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya have a version that was not in chronological order >>> haruhi-suzumiya

Well the question says it all I m really interested in the idea of cross overs in anime I want to know which particular company or manga group artists started the idea of cross overs and what particular anime s showed cross overs in anime history and the characters involved in it As I have searched from Wikipedia A fictional crossover short crossover is the placement of two or more otherwise discrete fictional characters settings or universes into the context of a single story They can arise from legal agreements between the relevant copyright holders unauthorized efforts by fans or even amid common corporate ownership I think that defines cross overs in anime as well cause anime and manga stories are mostly fictional hence may work the same way in the anime industry Correct me if I m wrong but the general idea I have about it is that they can only do cross overs if they anime characters and anime are in the same company or copyright e g Clamp So far most of Clamp animes did cross overs like the cross over of the characters of Cardcaptor Sakura Chobits Clamp School Detectives same names and faces but with different roles to Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle Another is the popular cross over of characters and even story of Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle XXXHolic Kobato and several Clamp made animes that I might have forgot to mention Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle focuses in the cross over ideas since they travel different worlds and meet the same people they met from the previous world they ve been yet with different attitude and roles Another example I know is the cross over of Lupin III along Fujiko and others in a Detective Conan movie Lupin III VS Detective Conan And Conan Edogawa s appearance in an episode of Yakitate Japan I m not sure which episode it is I don t know if Detective Conan Lupin III and Yakitate Japan are animes from the same company or copyright Are they P S I hope this question won t be closed since this will really be educational for anime fans out there >>> anime-history crossovers
The Rebuild of Evangelion series of films of which have been released here in the USA are a sort of reboot retelling of the Neon Genesis Evangelion story As films they have less time to tell the story and have a higher budget so the storytelling is decidedly different The original Evangelion has been discussed and analyzed in the many years since its release and I m curious if the new films have shed any new light on the original work Have the Rebuild films revealed new things about the original Evangelion series >>> neon-genesis-evangelion

In Durarara episode the story tells us about a girl named Kamichika Closer to the end of the episode after Celty brings her to the roof to meet Izaya he lets Kamichika to the roof edge telling her that a lot of people have jumped there and trying to persuade her that she s not a special case After that he leaves and Kimichika after some hesitation decides to jump down However Celty saves her Izaya s motivations here are a little confusing Even if we forget that he has ordered to kidnap and rescue the girl just for the fun of it he is being somewhat inconsistent when telling her about all the people who jumped from the roof At first it seems that his actions are directed toward helping Kimichika by showing her that her case is neither special nor too bad and it is not worth to jump It even seems to work at first when the girl starts hesitating However when Izaya leaves she still decides to jump off the roof When Izaya sees Celty helping the girl he doesn t act surprised at all much as if he was expecting this scenario However he could neither be sure that Kimichika will jump nor that Celty will save her I think he didn t even know that Celty didn t leave So does this portray him as a person who knew that Celty would save the girl and because of that the girl will once again understand that life s worth living Because in the other case he is rather portrayed as a man who can force another person to suicide just for the fun of observing that person s behavior >>> durarara

I sometimes watch this anime called Crayon Shin chan in Portuguese in which it is simply called Shin chan Flirty as he is Shinnosuke its main character is often inconveniently messing around with women Sometimes he walks up to them and as if to break the ice asks them Do you like peppers After this either the women get very embarassed or his mother knocks him in the head or both Also in one opening theme he sings that pepper tastes so bad Is this something specific to the Portuguese version of the anime Is its only significance related to his childishness him being a five year old child Or is it supposed to mean anything other than that and makes more sense in Japanese >>> symbolism crayon-shin-chan
I know the title probably needs to be changed but I wasn t sure how to put it spoiler free The question follows as a block for its spoilery nature for anyone who hasn t seen Naruto Shippuden up to episode In this episode Kabuto summons several shinobi using Edo Tensei For this jutsu we know that a living body to act as receptacle and a piece of DNA from the one being revived are needed The summoner will then use a tag to control the summoned soul s personality Kabuto explains to Naruto and Sakura that the water in the Hole is so rich that he was able to create life with those weird snakes embedded with Orochimaru s chakra I assume this means that the body that comes out of the water is the living body that serves as sacrifice I assume this because Hidan s eyes look like those of the ones summoned by Edo Tensei And afterwards Kabuto inserts a tag in this Hidan to control his personality Considering that Hidan was really summoned by Edo Tensei however there is the fact that his body does not look complete But then again I don t think we ve ever seen a naked Edo Tensei summoned body so we cannot be sure if this is normal or not So basically Is this some weird jutsu that really looks like Edo Tensei Or should we assume that Hidan as died and this was really Edo Tensei It is possible that Hidan is dead if you take into consideration what is explained in this answer >>> naruto

As we know Sasori has turned his body into a puppet with a small core of living flesh being the only living part of it This question also states that when summoned by Edo Tensei the reincarnated seem to retain any permanent body damage and physical limitations they received during their lifetime Obviously Sasori would fall under someone who had suffered some physical limitations We know that after being brought back by Edo Tensei Sasori eventually was released and vanished like any other summoned shinobi of flesh and bones so it clearly wasn t another puppet So how was Kabuto able to summon Sasori If the reincarnation retains body damage wouldn t he only be able to reincarnate Sasori s Living Core I doubt that the process of enchanting which Kabuto can perform involves re making the whole body >>> naruto

According to the Naruto Wiki page on Jiraiya he left Konoha so he could follow Orochimaru s movements as well as those of Akatsuki an organisation which Orochimaru had eventually joined Orochimaru was at Konoha during the Chuunin Exam Arc making his first appearance as far as I remember during the second phase in the Forest of Death Jiraiya made his first appearance between the preliminaires and the finals in chapter There is a fairly short period of time between these two appearances We quickly see that Jiraiya knows who Naruto is as he is trying to control his chakra to walk on water in chapter He first notices something when he sees Naruto trying to walk on water We then have a full confirmation that he knows who he is In this chapter he also notices that there is some weird overlaying of seals which he deduces was Orochimaru s work Now my question is Did Naruto and Jiraiya meet by chance as Jiraiya was tracking down Orochimaru s movements in which case Jiraiya only knew who Naruto was after seeing the seal in his stomach Or did he know who Naruto was before having seen him trying to walk on water and tracked him down possibly to protect him from Orochimaru and in which case he would ve been watching over Naruto since his parents died >>> naruto

The first question would be like Can he create Rasen Shuriken in kyuubi form BECAUSE when Naruto created FRS he threw it in air since he was in sage mode he controlled nature energy hence he could controlled even after throwing it in air But Kyuubi form isn t like that chakra comes from inside of him not from outer nature If I am not wrong beast chakra is like natural energy So recalling Naruto s sage technique It is just a free form energy which he could mould as rasengan Wind nature chakra creating a rasen shuriken But adding his wind chakra to create maximum of rasen shurikens used to bring his Sage mode to an end Now if he is granted with unlimited chakra from Kyuubi the tails can he build unlimited number of rasen shuriken >>> naruto
What is the primary principle of controlling Jinchuuriki I can think of two possibilities Control on hatred negative thoughts Will and wish of tailed beast Killer Bee could easily get in a good relationship with Hachibi We can recall the Falls of Truth incident of Bee where he could easily pass it in a second because he didn t have any hatred about anyone around him in his heart So is it because he had suppressed negative thoughts hence he got his tailed beast under control Or is it because Hachibi himself is a really good guy who is broadminded enough to lend his chakra to Bee >>> naruto

During the Land of Waves arc Kekkei Genkai is defined as techniques which are unique to a clan and passed down through the bloodline After timeskip it is touched upon again and is now defined as a technique which combines two elements Looking back at the Land of Waves arc Haku s Ice Release satisfies this definition as well However Sharingan and Byakugan are also called Kekkei Genkai although they do not combine any elements Later Terumi Mei is showed to use Lava release and Boil release and they are both considered Kekkei genkai although it appears that this is something unique she achieved not passed down through bloodline Thus the term kekkei genkai seems to be used in various contexts to mean either Bloodline techniques passed down through generations but not involving combining basic elements Sharingan Byakugan users Techniques combining basic elements but not passed down through bloodline Terumi Mei and a few others Combining basic elements and passed down through bloodline Haku What exactly does it mean Edit It looks like people have not understood the question Let me try again Does kekkei genkai mean A techniques passed down through blood B techniques which combine basic elements C Both A and B The answers as well the commenter below seem to have assumed A To make it even easier here s a related follow up question If Naruto learns Lightning Release and then combines with his Wind Release would that be kekkei genkai or not >>> naruto

Most of Nanoha s attacks consist of emitting some beam or ball of energy through her body or Raising Heart and firing it at the enemy For instance here s Divine Buster Presumably she just uses her own magical energy for this But Starlight Breaker is an exeption to that The energy seems to gather up and fire at the energy from thin air Different versions depict it differently but it always seems like the energy isn t coming from Nanoha directly except the little bit that she uses to initiate the attack Here s the movie version it s especially apparent in the upper left corner Is this just a visual quirk of the attack or does it actually work differently from her other ones And if so where is all that energy coming from >>> nanoha

In Nanoha StrikerS season several of the high end mages had limiters imposed on them to limit their power output thereby reducing their mage rank levels Nanoha Takamachi S reduced to AA Fate Testarossa S reduced to AA Hayate Yagami SS reduced to A Lutecia Alphine S reduced to D The purpose of the limiters was to limit the damage that could be caused to a small area and possibly to protect the mages themselves from overexerting Furthermore limiters can only be removed by a high ranked official With the exception of Lutecia who was a captured antagonist why were the mages not trusted to remove their own limiters if their purpose was to prevent accidental collateral damage >>> nanoha

Norio Wakamoto is a veteran Japanese voice actor with a long portfolio of characters that he s voiced His craft is such that he often times gets pigeon holed into a certain character archetype that fits a particular acting style of his This acting style is so prominent that you often have people try to imitate his voice other voice actors actresses that try to imitate him for fun and even competitions at conventions like at Moe Culture Festival for imitating him These characters are usually evil but not necessarily an antagonist funny maybe a little crazy Characters like Onsokomaru x Shinobuden Victoreem Gash Bell Garuda Magical Quiz Academy Katakuriko Matsudaira Gintama Amagumo Desert Punk etc Are there any characters whether they fit this archetype or not that were designed specifically for Wakamoto to play I know there s Commander Wakamoto from Virgin Fleet which I didn t find really matching the archetype but it s hard to imagine that the names were just coincidence Was Commander Wakamoto designed to be played by Norio Wakamoto >>> voice-acting

The final episode of Star Driver is somewhat confusing to me While it s clear what events took place I don t understand why some of the characters did what they did Specifically why does Takuto decide to break Wako s seal to unleash the cybodies into the normal world For the entire series The Glittering Crux Brigade seeks to break the seal of all maidens to achieve the th phase Takuto was pretty much fighting against them for the entire series to stop this process So why in the final episode does he change his mind and break Wako s seal Note that is it implied that Wako actually allows Takuto to break her seal >>> star-driver
At one point Ed Al and Ling end up in a battle involving Gluttony Then Ed Ling and Envy are swallowed by Gluttony which lands them in another dimension It is also stated more than once that alchemists use the energy from the movement of the tectonic plates of the Earth s crust though this is not entirely accurate the inaccuracy is irrelevant for the purpose of this question This energy would not be present on another planet much less in another dimension In order to escape from this alternate dimension Ed performs human transmutation He uses Envy s philosopher s stone to do so meaning that he would not require this energy However prior to finding Envy Ed uses alchemy to fashion a cooking pot evidenced by the transmutation marks on the pot He also uses it to turn the iron from the blood into a weapon This should not be possible there should be no energy for the use of alchemy in that dimension Is this an oversight by the writer s or is there some explanation >>> fullmetal-alchemist

In the Nekomonogatari Black anime yt Kokoro Watari sometimes translated as demon sword Heartspan is shown with different lengths but it always appears to be bigger than Araragi The size changing isn t very noticeable unless you are actively checking so it could just be due to animator laziness but the fact that it is longer than Araragi is seems deliberate as it is drawn that way consistently in every scene Here is one screenshot of the sword compared to Araragi Both red lines are the same length Even if he is leaning over in the picture it s pretty clear that the sword is bigger than he is It s also clear when he gets cut in half However despite the fact that the sword is taller than he is it fits into his body It even fits in Shinobu s body though of course that could just be one of her abilities But to the best of my knowledge Araragi should not have any such ability In addition the sword is stuck in the ground after his legs disintegrate which also should not be possible if it was inside of him This could very well just be SHAFT following their usual style with the Monogatari novel adaptations where the visuals aren t meant to be taken literally Or it could be an indication of another ability of the sword Is there any evidence that yt Kokoro Watari has some ability that would allow it to fit inside Araragi s body e g changing size >>> monogatari-series

The ending of Mawaru Penguindrum had a lot of ambiguous symbolism My first impression was that the writer had no idea how to resolve the fundamental questions of the plot and thus had to throw out completely unresolvable symbolism in order to fake an ending A few of my driving questions throughout the series were as follows A A recurring motif of the show is that the main character would get possessed by a penguin hat and pull one or two characters into a kind of alternate reality where they were handcuffed To what degree was this a hallucination Likewise Penguins and plus the additional penguin were important characters who were not visible to most people in the show To what degree were they hallucinations and to what degree were they paranormal B Were there any forces in the story that were godlike in that they were both powerful and capable of passing judgement on mortals In particular at the end of the show it seems that two boys sacrificed their mortal lives for the sake of two girls Was this a sacrifice made to a god or other cosmic power >>> mawaru-penguindrum

Is there any anime created for colorblind people In general anime productions have a strong use of colors to increase the dramatic effect but colorblind people miss it and sometimes lose track of important parts of the history Image example not exactly from an anime but here is the original image in this site you can simulate how it looks to a colorblind just select the previous link and paste it there and just a clarification it s not exactly to me it s for a small one who we just found that can t correctly see some colors And also in the site I mentioned above I found a daltonize algorithm that changes colors so that colorblind people have a bit more contrast on the colors they miss so it improves the image to them Thanks >>> anime-production

I ve started to notice lately that the vast majority of anime that I can find anyway seems to have opening OP and ending ED sequences which are minute and seconds long Some examples though I m sure there are lots that I haven t covered Fullmetal Alchemist There are OPs and EDs all of which are long Digimon Tamers Steins Gate Both OP and ED are GaoGaiGar and Neon Genesis Evangelion The OPs are long though the EDs are only in duration Cardcaptor Sakura The OPs are did not check the ED durations There do seem to be some exceptions again far from an exhaustive list One Piece Though some episodes fit this pattern others have minute OPs and no EDs The combined duration is still the same though Akagi Kaiji OP is shorter than minute Ga rei Zero Aria During the OP or ED music which is long things unrelated to the OP ED sequence happen like actual parts of the episodes These lists are just examples of each and don t really show that the vast majority of anime I would wager or higher seem to follow the OP ED rule It is worth noting that most American series have openings which are seconds or minute in length Family Guy and the Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon are examples of this though there are far more When did the minute second duration of OPs and EDs start to come into popularity and is there a particular reason why they did so >>> theme-song anime-history

I m trying to remember the title of an anime I watched a while back I watched this anime sometime in Judging by what little I remember of the art style the anime was probably made sometime between and The episodes were minutes each and there were about of them The show had a lot of nudity and was pretty explicit but I m sure it wasn t hentai I somehow remember the plot very vividly despite forgetting the name It wasn t a very good show but I d still like to know what it was The anime was about producing some sort of hero sentai television show In that fictional television show there were several girls probably who were able to transform into different outfits and gain different abilities depending on their outfit The main character is a high school boy who is the camera man for the show who is secretly also the writer of the show He s also pretty perverted and a lot of the show is just him falling into erotic delusions The actresses playing the characters in the sentai show realize that he is actually the writer though they keep this a secret from him Somehow they all go to his school I think even though I m pretty sure some of them were elementary or middle schoolers In order to try to increase their screen time they all start trying to seduce him by getting into compromising situations like accidentally running into him naked or showing him their underwear The first half maybe more of the series is just random fanservice in that vein Later on he figures out that they know that he is the writer and that they ve been seducing him and decides to punish them by putting them into even more embarrassing situations causing wardrobe malfunctions on stage and doing all sorts of other abuses of power The series takes a sort of darker turn at this point though there s still plenty of fanservice However the plan backfires on him Some sort of controversy causes him to be taken off the project and I think the show was even cancelled Yet somehow there was a happy ending where all the actresses were still friendly with him and the show gets restarted and he might end up in a relationship with one of the girls The only thing I remember about the ending is that it was rather implausible so I don t know how that happened Does anyone have any idea what this anime could be >>> identification-request
I am looking for the name of a certain anime I saw when I was younger It was about a guy who was fleeing into the mountains for some reason In these mountains he found a woman After kissing her he found out that he became immortal and lived for thousands of years I also remember that the moment they kissed he would feel inhuman pain for consecutive days Edit I can t properly remember the art style or the music used I am sure it was a series around episodes I watched it subbed and don t believe there was any dubbed version I don t really watch those so didn t pay attention to that I believe it was a Madhouse production but I can t tell that for sure The moment I started watching it had just about ended and I believe the end was a bit of a vampire like story or at least hinted at a vampire like plot I remembered a bit more about the plot it was set in medieval times between and I think But halfway through the plot he loses consciousness and stays so for years and ends up in a post apocalyptic Japan where he starts to search for his beloved the one who kissed and made him immortal Also it was not when I watched it but the end of I read the manga in >>> identification-request

If you ve seen CosPrayers you probably remember it as one of the worst anime you ve watched The story made no sense with many important story elements being cut out entirely The characters had no personality terrible acting and their actions didn t make sense There was pretty much no explanation for what was happening either The camera angles were strange The random fanservice also kills any attempt at a serious tone but the show seems to be trying to take itself seriously It s just all around a bad show Wikipedia even claims that the show spawned a minor meme Worse than CosPrayers to describe incredibly terrible shows If that were all then we could just write off the show as one of anime s great failures but the abomination continued with Smash Hit Hit wo Nerae and LOVELOVE These series were aired in sequence immediately after CosPrayers and produced by the same people In them CosPrayers is a live action television show and both shows are about the production of CosPrayers It is plagued with numerous problems including poor management lack of experience of the producers unsuitable content and even actresses seducing the screenwriter to try to get more screentime If a real show was plagued with so many problems I imagine the result would be pretty bad So it s almost understandable why CosPrayers was so bad especially if it was intended to add to the story of the other two series However if that was their goal I d imagine that airing CosPrayers last rather than first of the three would be the better approach It s also rather unbelievable that a studio would create a bad show deliberately since I can t imagine they d expect to make money off of it Still the show seems almost too bad to be true and some forum posts online claim that it was deliberately made that way to match the other two series better Is there any evidence suggesting that CosPrayers was made to be a bad show and the problems plaguing it were deliberate Or is this just fan speculation >>> anime-production love-love cosprayers smash-hit

Why does Lupin seem to be both skillful with women but also devoid of seriousness and is infantile towards women What is the source and purpose of this equivocated attitude towards women And Lupin is by no means the only male character to do this This theme seems to run like a red thread through most of the anime where male character seem to have the main role But compared to other male characters Lupin is an adult making faces Is there a Japanese culture influence in this funny faces making or this is just a manga anime original contribution >>> tropes lupin-the-third

There are a lot of western movies that are based from anime such as Dragonball Evolution Tekken Blood the Last Vampire based on Blood and Street Fighter The Matrix movie is also strongly influenced by Ghost in the Shell and the action scenes were drew upon their admiration for Ninja Scroll and Akira So my question is was there an anime produced based on a western movie or series not on western literature or novel so movies that are based on novel are excluded >>> anime-production
In the past three Naruto manga chapters chapters the story goes like this child days of both Hashirama and Madara and he Hashirama is just like every others in Naruto a normal human being But when Orochimaru revived all four Hokage in front of Sasuke Hashirama raises his chakra level to threaten Tobirama as it would crack all the walls nearby or maybe the entire basement chapter How could have Hashirama acquired this kind of power chakra >>> naruto

In Kobato Episode The Travellers Kobato met Syaoran Fye Kurogane and Mokona all of them looked more mature for me and I think Kurogane and Fye both grew hair Since Sakura wasn t with them is it safe to assume that this episode is somehow a sneak peek of the continuation of Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle ending in the manga showing their continuous journey Where the epilogue ends with Syaoran deciding to go on a journey in order to try and find a way for the soul of clone Syaoran who is his own father to be restored to a body Sakura has revealed that she had a dream which has given her a vision of the future so she can not go on the journey Apparently in order to escape from the final prison of Fei Wong Reed Syaoran gave up something Syaoran gave up being able to settle down in one place so now he s traveling endlessly with Kurogane and Fye who both decided to go with him and of course Mokona their transportation medium >>> tsubasa-chronicle kobato

The premise of Paca Plus is rather amusing the protagonist s girlfriend Yukari gets transformed into an alpaca Having played the trial it was pretty well done but the trial ends right when Yukari turns into an alpaca so it s difficult to judge the game based on that I m now at the point where I have to decide whether or not to buy the full game with not quite enough information to make the decision If Yukari never changes back and the whole game is just romance with alpaca Yukari that wouldn t really be my cup of tea To use a quote from the game However if Yukari occasionally changes back to her human form I could live with her being an alpaca most of the time That seems like something that could be played up for great comedic value and it wouldn t totally kill the romance So my question is does Yukari stay an alpaca forever or does she switch back to being a human >>> paca-plus

It seems to me that in a lot of anime Naruto Dragon Ball Gurren Lagann and Digimon are three that come to mind characters or creatures who perform an attack tend to shout its name almost as if necessary to perform such an attack This seems very counterintuitivetelling your opponent that you re about to use a fireball would open you up to being blocked very easily Why do anime characters tend to shout the names of their attacks Bonus points Has this spread into Western animation >>> tropes

In the film The Girl Who Leapt Through Time by Hosoda Mamoru the protagonist Makoto accidentally uses up all of the time leaps her friend Chiaki who is actually a time traveler from the future He used his remaining time leap to prevent an accident and thus was unable to return to the future However this seems to have a key plot hole If he still had one time leap remaining he could have gone to the future It s implied that in the future it s not terribly difficult to get such a time travel device or to recharge one Once he had a sufficient number of time leaps he could return to the past and prevent the accident In fact there wasn t really anything stopping him from doing so immediately after losing the device That may not be feasible for one reason or another depending on the time travel paradigm used in the movie However with my naive and incomplete understanding of how time travel is supposed to work it seems like it would solve all the problems It could also just be that Chiaki never thought of that but that s a rather boring answer Is there any explanation for why Chiaki couldn t just go to the future get another time travel device and give himself more time leaps >>> toki-wo-kakeru-shoujo

Most of the superpowers in the series seem to be related to two concepts namely Elements and Maken There are exceptions to this like Himegami s Shikigami but Elements and Maken are both referenced frequently and they seem to be how most of the characters fight However neither one was really explained at least in the anime It isn t really clear to me what either term means and how they re related It is clear that every character has a Maken which is basically a unique ability or power but there s a lot that s still confusing For instance for some characters their Maken seems to be an item that they use in combat while for others it s a power inside them Haruko s Maken is said to be contained in a different dimension and it opens a gate to the real world and seems to almost be a living thing What are Maken and how do they work Also what is the relationship between Elements and Maken >>> maken-ki

Across all Gundam universes there is always at least one character based on Char Aznable from the original Gundam series I say at least one because sometimes there is a softer character that is less obviously based on Char In Gundam Wing the obvious Char knockoff would be Zechs Marquise the tell tale characteristic is the mask He was the sister of Releena and the child of the Peacecraft family This an obvious nod to the fact that Char was really Casval Rem Deikun son of Zeon Dum Deikun His sister was Artesia Rem Deikun who took the alias Sayla and was an active member aboard White Base Quatra is the less obvious Char clone who shares Char s blonde hair and is named after the number Char in multiple Indian languages means four and his alias in Zeta Gundam was Lt Quatro In the most recent Gundam Unicorn Full Frontal is obviously the main Char character many in the show itself believing him to be the famed Red Comet while Ensign Ridhe is the softer Char character indicated by his blonde hair his family s ancestry and rivalry with the main character The Char character usually has some kind of cool nickname Char s is Red Comet and Zechs has the name Lightning Count Additionally their mobile suit is usually colored red or white Would this make Athuran Zala also a Char character with his signature Red mobile suits Basically what I m wondering is Is there a defined set of characteristics like the above mentions and their occurrences across all Gundam series whether they be Universal Century or not >>> gundam

After you marry your chosen girl or choose one but have the other two fully in love with you apparently you re given a movie called WIFE Release and an image based on that move called WIFE Freed maybe the other way around with WIFE being Linda Routier or Sayane Now I don t really understand why they use the wording because Linda Routier and Sayane die with Sieg at the end of the First Generation I m wondering Is this because of a bad translation from Japanese or is there some innuendo in which freed and release may mean to conceive a child considering what the images and movie actually represent NOTE I know this is a game but I have learned that questions to some games particular ones which are like a visual novel tend to get answers here rather than on Arqade if they re not directly related to gameplay such as questions about the story UPDATE I ve been playing Agarest Generations of War in Zero I got the marriage and a Sealed image from an event of the heroines from the first generation of Agarest Generation of War I thought that how they used Sealed was in the same way as Release and Freed however it does make sense to use Sealed in Agarest Generations of War The First Generation Heroines and most likely other generations but the last are sealed up with their husband in the Pillar However while it makes sense to use Sealed in Agarest Generations of War it still doesn t make sense to use Release and Freed in Agarest Generations of War Zero cause they aren t freed or released Of course while Linda Routier Sayane and Sieg return when you enter the Boundary Plane you can only get to the Boundary Plane if you get the True Ending and they are still dead >>> agarest-war-zero

I need help understanding what is going on with the Trenni silver coin scheme plot that is mentioned throughout episodes of Spice and Wolf season Let me explain what I understand and hopefully get some clarity about these Spice and Wolf episode plots also if someone can block out the impending spoilers that would be awesome I don t know how to do it So our main protagonist Lawrence gets word that the Trenni silver coin currency is about to go up in its silver purity This means that both the actual metal value of the Trenni silver coin and its representative value will go up This all turns out to be wrong though as Lawrence finds out the Trenni silver coins are actually becoming less pure and going down in value and what he was told was a lie This plot then leads Lawrence to go over to the Milone trading company where somehow he hopes to make a profit off of telling the company this info Now this is where it gets complicated How was the Milone trading company going to make money off of the devaluing currency and how was Medio involved with this In the anime the Milone Trading company upon hearing the devaluing silver info from Lawrence started stockpiling Trenni silver coins Why are they trying to stockpile the silver coins if their price and purity is going down Shouldn t they be trying to get rid of all of their Trenni silver coins if the value is decreasing Also it is mentioned that the Medio trading company is hiring people to give merchants the wrong info about how the Trenni silver coins are going up in value instead of actually going down Lawrence was even told this lie How does the Medio Trading company possibly gain any advantage from this Basically I am asking what is the economic plot in the episodes of Spice and Wolf season explained in little kid terms so I can hopefully comprehend what is going on in the story and enjoy the anime even more I am sorry for not being more economics savvy with this but if you understand the plot be much appreciated for some insight >>> spice-and-wolf

This contains spoilers for Another which is somewhat new the anime is from Another is an anime series about a cursed classroom The students and teachers have designed a countermeasure to avoid the curse from triggering each year which consists on completely ignoring a student treating them as non existent By doing this the number of students in the classroom is technically decreased by one which makes up for the extra dead student that got mixed in the class Misaki is the chosen student to be ignored by the classroom this year After a mess up Sakakibara is also ignored However if I m not mistaken during exam periods both students Misaki and Sakakibara have exam papers Why Doesn t giving them exam papers pretty much acknowledge that they exist Doesn t that break the entire countermeasure from the point of view of the classroom Edit For clarification the countermeasure involves people directly related to the class This means students that belong to this classroom and teachers that teach this class External students and teachers from other classrooms are not involved with the curse so they may interact with the non existant students just fine The librarian and students from the art club etc have no problem interacting with the non existant students The external students teachers are not very well aware of the curse though The cursed classroom tries not to talk about it with others >>> another

In chapter of the manga it is shown that Kakashi kills Rin This fulfills the requirement to activate the Mangekyou Sharingan So that should have been the moment when Kakashi was able to use the Mangekyou Sharingan Also the Yellow Flash was still alive when this happens so this means that Naruto was not yet born This clearly points to the fact that from the very beginning of the Naruto series Kakashi had his Mangekyou Sharingan activated When Kakashi first fought Itachi when Itachi and Kisame appear at Konoha and faced the Tsukuyomi he was devastated in a moment even though he had his Mangekyou Sharingan active though not used But the next time they face during the rescue mission of Gara he was able to withstand it Now my first question is was Kakashi unaware of his Mangekyou Sharingan until he faced Itachi or was he not proficient in using it Also why in the Naruto series I mean the series before the start of Shippuden didn t Kakashi use his Mangekyou Sharingan Now for my second question in the same chapter a few pages back just when Kakashi strikes the blow at Rin Obito s vision starts to fade as he can sense Rin dying Does this mean Obito s Mangekyou Sharingan was awakened at the same time We know that Kakashi and Obito shares the same other dimension because of the same Sharingan that the both use not the same eye but the eye of the same Uchiha So does the same apply for their activation of Mangekyou Sharingan >>> naruto
Lets have a back drop on the story the Third Hokage shows Jiraya Tsunade and Orochimaru his summoning technique This intrigues Jiraya and he too tries to perform the jutsu without making a blood seal with an animal As a result he is teleported to Mount Myoboku where the Toads live He trains there for sometime Here lies my first question until later into his training Jiraya had not made a blood seal with the toads so how did he get to mount Myoboku to undergo his trainings The reverse kuchiyose should only work when there is a blood seal with the animal Going to Mount Myoboku on foot is a long and tiresome journey so this possibility too is cancelled out So in order to go to Mound Myoboku did he use the kuchiyose no jutsu every time My other question is what decides which animal a shinobi is to bond with There is a wide range of creatures that one can choose from but certainly there must be some sort of compatibility to be worried about What made Jiraya decide a toad summon would be best for Naruto Has anything that can substantiate the above points been mentioned in the manga >>> naruto

I know that in general the higher ranked manga tend to be shounen such as One Piece Bleach and Naruto based generally I think on readership Is there anything showing general demographic popularity such as the overall popularity of shounen vs shoujo vs seinen vs josei based on something like readership If so is shounen still the most popular How do the other ones rank in relation to each other >>> manga-production

So this synopsis is going to seem like it s all over the place but please bear with me I saw this anime movie that came out around the s or s most likely s It was set in the city probably Tokyo and it involved evil doppelgangers as the antagonists The protagonists assemble a group and each person in the group had to fight their own doppelganger I remember one of them was a prostitute And I think each time one of the main characters fought their doppelganger the environment changed The main protagonist defeats his evil doppelganger by decapitating him and the anime ends with him crying as he cradles his evil twin s head in his arms Again I know the description is a bit fragmented but I figured I would try my luck here Any help would be greatly appreciated >>> identification-request

I just finished watching the Mirai Nikki anime Haven t seen the manga The last standing player becomes god At the end either Yukiteru or Yuno have to die Yuno dies and Yukiteru is declared the winner of the game But how come if Ninth was still alive I had some assumptions Maybe at this point no one cares about the game s rules But then it wouldn t be necessary to kill either Yukiteru or Yuno So it seems like the rules must be followed no matter what Everyone thought that Ninth was dead So perhaps the system was fooled But this would prove that the game s rules have no kind of transcendental godlike authority as they are incapable of telling whether Ninth is still alive or not If that s the case the rules can be bended But if you could bend the rules then it wouldn t be necessary to kill either Yukiteru or Yuno When Deus saved Ninth maybe he kind of disqualified her from the game so she s not a player anymore and doesn t have to die I don t remember if this was mentioned or implied Was it How did Yukiteru win the game if Ninth was still living >>> mirai-nikki

Considering the extreme popularity of voice acting and voice acting schools in Japan I m curious to know if the industry actually classifies the quality of each voice I m not talking about things like age gender etc Rather I m interested in the tonal quality of the voice Personally I m particularly taken by the tonal quality of Mizuhara Kaoru the seiyuu who voiced Kusakabe Misao in Lucky Star Kusakabe s voice has got a thick musical quality to it and sounds double layered I m not the only one enamoured with Kusakabe s voice Her character Misao Kusakabe in Lucky Star gained a cult following in fans and spawned internet memes due to her own addition of a nonsensical vuah at the end of her sentence if it s picked up within seconds the germs don t get attached This began in the th episode of the anime where her character Misao was nervous and embarrassed after eating food that has been dropped on the ground in front of others The popularity was substantial enough to have a th Lucky Star character album featuring Misao released four months after the originally planned twelve albums were released even when her character already shared a duet character album as the th album This is at around the minute mark of the th episode >>> lucky-star voice-acting

I knew that the Robotech series was adapted from three other anime The Super Dimension Fortress Macross Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross and Genesis Climber MOSPEADA However I always thought that when it came to the SDF # it was either referring to Space Defense Fortress or Space Defense Force However when I was watching Episode Ghost Town the old guys referred to the crash warship as a Super Dimensional Fortress What does SDF actually mean in Robotech >>> robotech
From my understanding there are three SDFs The SDF which was the major focus of the first season The SDF which is the flagship of the Robotech Expeditionary Force REF where Rick Hunter is The SDF I wasn t too sure about as at first I thought it was a separate ship built but it was apparently destroyed with the SDF in the final episode of the first season Not entirely sure if it s a separate ship or the repaired SDF However in Episode Ghost Town the communications from the REF were coming from the SDF so I m wondering How many SDF # s are there and are they all the same as the SDF minus the aircraft carriers which were just a patch job >>> robotech

After Madoka recreates the universe so that magical girls disappear before they become witches there is a scene where Mami Kyouko and Homura come out from a battle and Kyouko is upset about Sayaka being gone Did Sayaka disappear during that fight or did the three just come out from fighting her witch thus Madoka not getting to Sayaka in time >>> madoka-magica
Since witches are actually magical girls who when their soul gems are fully tainted become witches that means that Walpurgisnacht was a magical girl Since Madoka in two realities became a witch that could destroy the world universe that would mean there was a magical girl who was at the time much stronger than Madoka before Homura s trips to the past compiling Madoka s fate and power Which magical girl became Walpurgisnacht Were they like Madoka and had their fate compiled from overlapping timelines >>> madoka-magica

In the first Shingeki no Kyojin opening I ve seen some scenes with lower contrast or brightness something like this And later in the same sequence a scene appears without that contrast change I ve seen this kind of contrast change in the HxH remake as well and the first thing that comes to my mind is that legendary Pokemon episode where a lot of kids suffered of photosensitive epilepsy attacks in Japan thanks to Pikachu and Co Does it has some relationship with that or there is another reason Maybe a new law in Japan related to these flashy images on TV It seems this change appears only in new anime I don t remember seeing something like this before last year Any clue around that time UPDATED It s not just in the opening here are more examples One of many scenes where the image is normal Then comes the darker scenes Maybe it cannot be appreciated in the snapshots but all are a full sequence of images appearing quickly with a bright background And then it returns to normal This is from the last HxH episode At first the image looks fine Then comes an attack and the image looks darker Maybe the effect is not so intense as in Shingeki no Kyojin but it is still there Look all these bright flashes coming from the hits seem not as bright as they should be And then the image looks normal again compare the smoke color before and after As JonLin notes maybe it could be some kind of TV censorship despite that there s nothing to censor besides all these flashy lights Is it just me being paranoid or is there something more behind all this UPDATE I ve found a Blu ray rip of the Shingeki no Kyojin opening no subtitles no credits and I took some shots of the same frames that I already put To the left the TV version and to the right the BDRip version click for more detail So it is not an effect to make things more dramatic but rather an effect included only on TV I suppose the same applies to the other shots at least in SnK So my question comes again why lately are there some anime with darkened scenes My conspiracy theory is that it is related to those bright changes and possible photosensitive attacks If that s true why is this being applied lately And why doesn t it appear on DVD BD If not what else it could be >>> anime-production

Since Chapter is currently the latest chapter the question will be in spoilers My question specifically pertains to whether or not all shinobi descended from the Sage of Six paths Is this what Madara is implying in the last panel of this picture in effect taught us all chakra I think there are multiple ways to interpret this One is that all shinobi are related to Kaguya meaning everyone related knows how to use chakra And two is that if one knows how to use chakra then all their offspring will be born into the world able to use chakra Therefore the Sage of Six paths can simply teach others how to use chakra and then everyone else knows There were probably some words lost in translation so I am just confused now Did all shinobi descend from the Sage of Six paths or did the Sage simply just teach others how to use chakra >>> naruto

Looking for an horror series I found a new one called Yami Shibai Each episode is a very short horror ghost story I feel like many of the stories in this series are too incomplete as in lacking any story development it almost seems as if the producer is just making up some random nonsensical stuff in an attempt you scare you off But maybe the stories presented do have a background story like a reference to a well known ghost story or something Some of the stories presented do seem to be somewhat self contained For instance the third episode Family Rule does explain the situation the adults are offering their own laughter to please an evil spirit but other stories don t explain what s going on for instance the photocopier episode there s just this ghost haunting a photocopier but we don t know why or what for etc Are the Yami Shibai horror stories based on something or are they just made up for this series They might be well known japanese stories but I don t know much about japanese culture so I m not sure >>> yami-shibai

When watching FMA Brotherhood when van Hohenheim is talking to Pride he refers to him as Puraido when he is talking to him by name but when he is listing the seven deadly sins he uses the term which is pronounced gouman Is there any indication of why the character name is different from the term itself This is probably true for all seven of the Homunculi but I only noticed it specifically for Pride >>> fullmetal-alchemist
Throughout FMA Brotherhood fighting has been breaking out having been orchestrated by the Homunculi to power the giant transmutation circle that makes up Amestris In most if not all of the fighting it seems to be that the Amestrians are suffering great numbers of casualties The fighting at Fort Briggs for example was orchestrated so Fort Briggs would be weak so they could be massacred It is necessary that Amestrians to die for it to work and that is why it is being set up so they are on the losing side or is there some other reason like it is easier to make the Amestrians lose >>> fullmetal-alchemist
Occasionally especially when talking about human transmutations Amestrians mention God mainly with the idea of human transmutations being a transgression against God An example of this is when Olivier Armstrong is talking about the three tenets for state alchemists and is answering the question of why human transmutations are forbidden It doesn t seem to me like this is a reference to Truth seeing as very few people seem to know about Truth who is essentially the God within the gate Is there some specific religion s God that this is reference to or it is a sort of generic God nature Is there a stated religion within Amestris >>> fullmetal-alchemist

First I am wondering how exactly does this plan work in the Narutoverse When everyone is under the genjutsu does that mean no one is actually living their own life Or do people live their lives and the usage of the genjutsu just eliminates pain suffering and war Will the people starve to death under this technique And if not are they able to reproduce And if they can do the above two will this technique eventually cease when Madara Obito die I m just wondering if life can still continue under this technique If so does the technique ever stop Now on a more deeper philosophical level how is this plan any different from Pain s total destruction plan Both goals of the two plans are the same They both want to end pain suffering and war Pain wanted to cause destruction to achieve his goal Obito Madara wants to put the whole world under a genjutsu to achieve their goal and they are willing to cause total destruction in the process Is there any real difference in outcomes The way I see it pain is inevitable in human life So then why bother with the Eye of the Moon plan if you can just kill the entire planet I m going to assume that if they have what it takes to execute this plan they also have what it takes to just blow up the planet eliminate all living beings This then leads me to believe that Madara and Obito just have psychological problems Is this the reason why they are proceeding with this crazy plan >>> naruto

Bugging me for years I saw an anime in the early s I assume it was from around then since I watched it on a VHS tape that featured a war between a group of pilots maybe or that could join into giant robot This robot had a red head with red spikes kind of like the Statue of Liberty The bad guys had giant robots that could join together too to form giant super robot and there were maybe of them I think it was feature length but possibly several episodes of a series put together Also it seemed to me to not be childish It wasn t adult but PG ish I recall it being sort of dark and sinister and violent Please help me Oh and it wasn t Voltron or anything obvious like that >>> identification-request
I was listening to the original song used as the opening for the first season of Hakuki and I realized that the tempo in the original was slower I also listened to Vampire Knight s opening and READY STEADY GO which was used as one of the openings for the original Fullmetal Alchemist anime and they too had slower tempos than I originally thought I know that when a song is used as an opening for an anime it gets cut down to about minute in most cases it s about of the original But does the song also get edited so it plays faster or is this increase in tempo a result of the quality being dropped >>> anime-production theme-song

During the rounds where Aki and Yji face off against Kyji and Yka Yji reveals a photo album of Kyji cross dressing which came from when he lost to Class F in the first season and was forced to obey Yji and cross dressed for a day The difference between the anime and the manga light novels is that photos of Kyji cross dressing where taken in private by Kta which Yka found the dumped him in the Anime she see him cross dressing when Class C along with Classes D and E ganged up on Class A in Mock Wars to tire them out before the real War between Class A and F However in the OVA it explains how Kta took the photos and afterwords Yka is looking though them burns the album and dumps Kyji almost as if she never saw him Cross Dress during the Mock Wars I am wondering does the OVA of Baka and Test more closely adapt to the Manga Light Novels than the first season of the anime did >>> baka-and-test

This is the final scene of the first episode of Cowboy Bebop Right before this gif starts Spike was gazing into space from the window The following events depicted in this gif are contradicting First Jet rather slowly floats down from the ladder to stand on the floor steadily It s because they are in space that he was floating but his approaching footsteps can be heard which means he s wearing some magnetic boots which let him stick to the floor Jet is holding a cigarette from which the smoke goes off vertically upwards away from the floor like it would on Earth Jet has a pair of sunglasses hanging downwards from his apron So there s either artificial gravity on the ship or the glasses are being held really tight in this position Jet then throws the cigarette to Spike and it floats in the air like it would in space smoke still going towards the ceiling Maybe the ventilation is designed so that the air flows from the floor towards ceiling Spike then catches the cigarette and its smoke continues going upwards whilst the smoke cloud that Spike exhales just floats onwards without changing its general direction This means it s not the ventilation that makes smoke go where it goes This is really confusing I get that such stuff can be easily overlooked in anime but the cigarette was clearly floating just now flying in a straight line so I m not buying all of it What is known about the gravity on Bebop >>> cowboy-bebop

As per my understanding Izanagi permanently blinds the Sharingan s vision once used Tobi Obito donated one eye to Kakashi and used Izanagi with the other eye to escape from Konan s paper bombs This means he should only have a Rinnegan now but why does he still have a Sharingan with Kamui ability Note I do not read manga >>> naruto

As we all know that Kurama s chakra is of the healing nature type This is known from many mentions about it in the wiki page of Naruto Uzumaki My question is what is the nature type of the chakra of the other Tailed beasts Note This is my thinking why there should have been a nature type to each of the tailed beasts As we all know that when Rikud Sennin was about to die he split his powers among his sons The older son inherited his powerful chakra and spiritual energy amp the younger son inherited his powerful life force and physical energy Similarly when creating the tailed beasts from the Shinju he must have split the chakra based on their nature so that each tailed beasts had a unique natured chakra Any insights on this would be very much welcomed >>> naruto

After the summer field trip Teshigawara and Mochizuki re record Matsunaga s message about how to stop the Calamity after it s started with an emphasis on the actions being discussed so that no one regrets the decision and also to prevent the same insanity that took over the entire class during the summer trip However that happened after the Extra had been killed It was revealed earlier from Matsunaga s account of killing the Extra that only the person responsible for the Extra s death will remember it for a short while When Sakakibara showed everyone the class photos that were taken when they arrived no one sees or even knows of the Extra which Sakakibara and Mei can see and remember Sakakibara remembers Reiko because he was the one who killed her after learning that she was the Extra Mei remembers because not only was she there and about to do the killing herself but as she also revealed she remembers seeing Reiko die Her false eye could also contribute to her remembering However since only Sakakibara and Mei remember the Extra how do Teshigawara and Mochizuki remember that it was the death of the Extra that stopped the Calamity since it was once that killing the Extra stopped the Calamity so it wasn t proven that there was a link >>> another

the calamity is caused when someone who has died is added to class everyone s memories and records regarding the Extra are altered by some unseen force and the Extra has a physical body allowing the rest of the class to interact with him her however when describing what may have caused the calamity to exists when class year prior refused to accept the girl s death and started to act as if she still existed leading to her being in the graduation photo it starts off with one student refusing to accept her death and was at first thought to be seeing things until later more students confirmed until the teacher allowed the dead girl to remain in the class i am wondering did the girl who died prior obtain a physical existence like how the Extra s do or did the class just see her ghost >>> another

While I was watching Episode of Naruto Shippuden I found what I guess is a mistake First look at the picture Since Madara came he was using only Sharingan and this can be seen until in the picture while he was dodging Gaara s sand attacks However when Naruto was above him with an Odama Rasengan Madara suddenly could be seen with the Rinnegan on his eyes and nobody noticed it like if it was a mistake It should have been normal Sharingan Then at Madara was using the Mangekyou Sharingan since he activated it after Naruto s attack to invoke the Susanoo And after that at around Madara was targeted by a photon shuriken hence he had to activate the Rinnegan and that was at It was the first time that he did it since he came to life with Edo Tensei and that could be confirmed from everybody s reaction when they saw his Rinnegan at around Why does he have the Rinnegan Was it a mistake that they drew Madara with the Rinnegan at >>> naruto animation-mistakes

Okay this question comes up in my mind most of the times Considering the basic law on life and death When a body part is taken from a dead body it can never get that back But in naruto many reanimated ninja s had lost their eye of some or the other reason Sharingan rinnegan and byakugan mainly As far as i know sasuke has taken itachi s eyes to awaken his powers So then how could itachi get his sharingan back when kabuto reanimated him Is there any kind of logic behind this which I ve missed out Or is that some law in the shinobi world Obito had taken over Nagato s rinnegan yet nagato had the rinnegan when he was reanimated Considering the power of rinnegan which creates stuff there hasn t been any scene where sharingan and other eyes of rinnegan were created and transplanted into itachi and nagato >>> naruto
Until the th ninja war a Mangekyou Sharingan user had been showcased as a formidable enemy with Genjutsu being one of their many powerful techniques Itachi was adept with Tsukuyomi Sasuke suppressed the Nine Tails power with his Sharingan when Naruto faced him in Orochimaru s hideout It would be fair to consider that both Tobi and Madara are equally adept if not better with the Genjutsu abilities of the Mangekyou Sharingan However in the th Ninja War they do not use Genjutsu much It could be argued that a Sharingan user may be able to cancel out Sharingan s Genjutsu but Genjutsu could still be effective against a non Sharingan user such as Naruto or Bee Tobi could easily put them under Genjutsu and take over their tailed beasts but he has not done it He did not use it on Guy either when they fought Is there a reason why the Sharigan users did not use Genjutsu in the th Ninja War >>> naruto
I know that the villagers of Konoha were afraid of the Kyuubi because of its rampage on the village and that the Fourth Hokage saved the village by sealing it inside Naruto Based on this answer the Third Hokage hid his identity to protect him Did the Third Hokage hide only Naruto s relation with the Fourth or also him being the Kyuubi jinchuriki If so did the villagers find out because Naruto went out of control with the Kyuubi s chakra Edit To make clear what I am exactly curious about Why didn t they also hide Naruto s identity as a jinchuriki so the villagers will not hate him >>> naruto

I ve been following this walkthrough for Katahane and I m do the Angelina Ending because I brought the game purely to see the romance between Angelina and Belle however I do plan to get the Wakaba and Coco Endings after since I m a completionist Are all of the interactions between Angelina and Belle covered in the Angelina Ending Are there any scenes between them that only viewable in Wakaba s and Coco s Routes EDIT After completing what i think is the Angelina Ending it seems to end abruptly and the Wakaba ending seems to have more of a conclusion to Angelina and Belle i still got to get the Coco Ending just to check but it seems that maybe the walk through might be lacking with the Angelina ending also my friend who made the censor patch said that there are Angelina x Belle H Scenes and the logs state that it s only blocked which she finds strange so she s right now looking though her code just to see if the censor patch blocked and entire section but didn t log it >>> katahane
Awhile ago I was re watching some of the Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood episodes in French specifically to reference something else I noticed that in Mustang uses the tu form the informal you when talking to Hawkeye after being persuaded against finishing off Envy which seems a bit odd From the episodes chapters I ve read in French they seem to usually use the vous form the formal you Does this correspond to anything in the Japanese original and if so what does it correspond to I ve seen some other unexpected usages of tu elsewhere but they weren t with characters that I ve seen enough of in the French version to be able to see if it was unusual for people to use the tu form with them in the context of the text >>> fullmetal-alchemist japanese-language
I ve noticed in Casual Romance Club and Katahane that on the disk there is an OMAKE folder inside the OMAKE folder there were added images and sound files Casual Romance Club has images of each of the girl s in swimsuits at the beach and a portrait image while with Katahane the images were headshots like what you would see in some JRPGs a slo in the Katahane folder there were movies The one thing both have which is the exact same is that there is a htm file which when opened seems to have links to every file in the folder I ve completed a number of routes in Casual Romance Club but none of them has a beach event nor is there space in the gallery for the beach images and the beach images are different to the swimsuit images which are viewable at the beginning I know they don t get installed and since both Casual Romance Club and Katahane are done by different developers to my knowledge it makes me think OMAKE is actually a term used outside specific visual novels So I am wondering what is an OMAKE >>> terminology

It is kind of intriguing that the Death Note never runs out of pages The number of pages of the Death Note will never run out Source Since it s made of an unknown matter it s not really that difficult to believe but we didn t really see the effects of this rule in the anime which I guess could be more important than most of the rules unless you show me some other point of view in the answers by analyzing The thickness of the Note should increase By assuming that the number of pages will increase every time you use the Note pages to make it endless we would clearly see that the Death Note will get more thick since the number of pages is rising and we would clearly see that the Note of Light would be too thick after his long years using it The already written pages remains We could also deduce that the pages that are already filled does not disappear since both L and Near did analyze the names written on the Notes and the names of the dead victims as another evidence of conviction Now as a question We know that the user can rip some pages from the Note to use them later now what would happen if the user rips all the pages from the last one filled to the end cover of the Note for using them later a It will be judged as destroying the Note Or b It will be judged as ripping some pages If a the Note will be rendered useless If b would other pages appear in the Note In case they appear could the user keep ripping off pages and giving them to hundreds of people making Kira every where Why didn t Yagami Light do such a thing as becoming the master of the page users and the only one knowing their names in case they disobey him and as a result creating an army for him self made of the Kira fans Check also Will a page ever run out >>> death-note

If the Gedo Mazo is the emptied body of the Ten tails then why don t any of his forms look like that I have a theory as to why it doesn t have tails maybe because its chakra was split into the tailed beasts it lost its tails But it still doesn t explain why none of the forms look like that considering that the Gedo Mazo is the way the body looked when Hagoromo Outsutsuki the Sage of the Six Paths sealed its empty body inside the moon with Chibaku Tensei Planetary Devastation Any ideas as to why this might be >>> naruto

After discussing the matter of whether the Death Note will ever run out of pages it appears to me that there is another unclear matter which is whether the page itself can ever run out You can easily take a page use an erasable pen and write carefully then when filled erase the entire writing without damaging the page You will always be able to kill other people using that same page I have the following sub questions Is this even possible that is can you kill people after writing on an erased page When do we say that the Death Note has run out See the picture below which says that when you run out of room to write you can ask your Shinigami to bring you another Death Note If I fill my note ask the Shinigami for another one then erase what was written on my first note will I have made two Death Notes for myself If the above is true and since the rules imply that no more than six Death Notes can be brought to the human world why didn t Yagami Light do that to get six Death Notes ensuring that no one else gets a Death Note How does the Shinigami tell that the Note is filled or not Does he just look at the pages and see whether they are written or not Death Note Manga Pilot Chapter page >>> death-note
The names of all the ships in One Piece are suffixed with Go in Japanese For example Going Merry Go Thousand Sunny Go Moby Dick Go However the English version drops the Go suffix This suggested it might be a honorific used to address a ship but I couldn t find any source that says Go is a honorific There s also no mention of Go on the Japanese ship naming conventions page on Wikipedia and I couldn t find anything like this in any other place either I don t recall this being explained in the manga Is there any explanation for this use of Go with a reliable source for reference >>> one-piece
The Rinnegan originally belonged to the Sage of the Six Paths He then divided his power between his two sons which formed the Senju and the Uchiha For any human being to be able to activate Rinnegan they need both the Uchiha and Senju DNA Uchiha Madara in the last days of his life was able to activate it as he already had the Eternal Mangekyo and Hashirama s cells Senju DNA making him similar to the Sage But the question how was Nagato able to re activate it Yes it was Madara who had implanted his Rinnegan in him at small age but then even though the eyes were implanted Nagato neither had the Uchiha DNA or the Senju DNA to be able to re activate the Rinnegan How was he able to do it And as a continuation to it let s assume he was able to re activate the already awakened Rinnegan Madara awakened it originally how was he able to use it so well and control it without his body taking a toll He belonged to the Uzumaki clan who may have been the distant relatives of Senju that doesn t justify how he was able to control it so well as he did not have any traits of the SO P unlike Madara who could now be compared to the Sage with both DNAs and the Rinnegan An example to highlight this is of Kakashi He got a Sharingan from Obito But since Kakashi wasn t an Uchiha his body would take a huge toll on him whenever he used it and had to cover his Sharingan when not using to save Chakra Though later he trained and excelled at it he still was a non Uchiha and thus his body used to take the toll though only after excessive usage Similarly since Nagato has no traits of the Sage his body shouldn t have been able to take the toll of Rinnegan activated full and controlling his Pain paths and all Can somebody please give a detailed explanation of how Nagato was able to awaken and control the Rinnegan >>> naruto
Warning Spoilers ahead The final season of Chica Umino s Honey and Clover ended with Yuuta Takemoto eating a literal honey and clover sandwich made by his love interest Hagumi Hanamoto He was crying as he ate it and said the lines which made me tear up just like the other moments of the series Id been wondering whether there is a meaning to a failed love Is something that disappeared the same as something that never existed But now I know there is There was a meaning right here Because despite the heartbreak Im still glad that I fell in love with you Yuuta Takemoto read more I wonder if Umino made the end a cliffhanger an open ended one or if there is a theory out there in the Internets that could shed a light into this Do you guys know anything post season >>> honey-and-clover

In anime that were adapted from a manga if it follows the manga it would either follow it faithfully Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood or deviate from the manga s plot line Oran High School Host Club Original Fullmetal Alchemist In my experience anime deviations from manga normally occur because the manga is still ongoing and original filler is not enough Given how both the Naruto anime and manga are still ongoing I am wondering if the anime of Naruto has deviated from the manga to the point where it could break continuity with the manga For example the Fullmetal Alchemist anime breaks continuity at Laboratory or when we learn who Sloth and Wrath are >>> naruto anime-production
Why was the Shinobi War started if Kyuubi chakra was all needed Without Naruto Kyuubi and Killer B Hachibi being captured the eternal genjutsu Moon Eye was initiated by Tobi Madara The reason being they could do it is because they had Hachibi s one leg courtesy Sasuke and Kyuubi s chakra Gold and Silver brothers So which means all they needed is a sample chakra of Kyuubi since all tails were sealed it was enough powerful to begin Moon Eye also they had Hachibi s leg why did Tobi initiate the war he could have collected Kyuubi chakra somehow If Tobi knew about it earlier could the war have been avoided His ambition could have been achieved without any war >>> naruto

In the post credits scene of the series Homura is seen wandering the desert where the scene concludes with her sprouting dark wings and flying off After seeing Rebellion this seems connected in that it takes place in Homura s rewritten universe after she becomes a demon which is what the wings represent I m not too sure though what confuses me is that Homura is still wearing Madoka s ribbon in the post credits scene while in Rebellion she gave it back in the end after her we may end up enemies speech Ultimately what does this scene represent now that Rebellion exists >>> madoka-magica

The final OP for Monogatari Series Second Season the Koimonogatari OP is sort of an s throwback sort of deal with all the hallmarks of old anime styling funky lens flares those old school clouds a song reminiscent of s era pop captioned lyrics the works One particularly interesting feature of the OP is that it credits KAMIYA Hiroshi and SAITOU Chiwa as the voice actors of Koyomi and Hitagi respectively No TV anime from the past two or three years that I have watched has to the best of my recollection credited a voice actor in the opening credits The opening credits typically seem to be reserved for producers directors original creators and people like that Voice actors are of course credited in the ending credits usually towards the beginning And so the question Was it more common back in say the s or thereabouts for voice actors to be credited in anime opening credits in place of or in addition to the ending credits Or alternatively is this aspect of the presentation of the Koimonogatari OP just idiosyncratic anachronistic otherwise not in keeping with common practice from a few decades ago >>> anime-history theme-song monogatari-series

During the game there is a scene where someone discovers a fossil of the Utawarerumono apparently an archeologist and it s hinted that the Utawarerumono is the missing link between man and ape or the origin of man The fossil has what looks to be Hakuro s mask on it as well The archeologist is then shot by the person he was talking to apparently a guard Now we know that the Iceman is the Utawarerumono Hakuro and he was being experimented on so that humanity could become stronger to inhabit the world However I don t understand where the scene with the fossil fits in So I am wondering what the connection between the fossil and the rest of the story is >>> utawarerumono
In the ending of the visual novel Kamyu looked away from Aruru and said Oji sama which is how she referred to Hakuoro then Aruru told Kamyu to jump on Mukkuru and rode off The scene after that shows Eruru in what is believed to be her home village rebuilt Though it could be just the developers reusing the background it shows an isometric view of the village which looks almost as if the village had been repaired The final CG shows her looking towards the screen almost in shock I haven t seen the anime so I have no idea if this is elaborated on further However it almost seems as if Kamyu and Aruru saw Hakuoro and he returned to Eruru Hakuoro also said before he was sealed that he would one day see Eruru again However he could have been referring to how Eruru was a decedent of his ancient daughter So I am wondering if Hakuoro did come back >>> utawarerumono
In the aftermath of the battle with Kuuya Kuuya s mind regresses to a child too as Sakuya explains To go back to a time when she had no worries Hakuro blames himself as he had transformed and when he approached her she was screaming and clawing out of her Mecha However throughout the story Hakuro blames himself when he is able to help people close to him And before Kuuya regressed not only was Genjimaru killed but Dii also attacked her leaving her Mecha badly damaged I am wondering if it was really Hakuro being transformed that caused Kuuya to regress out of fear or if it were other factors that had occurred at that time >>> utawarerumono
When Genjimaru escapes with Sakuya and intends to give her to Hakuro as a hostage in exchange for Hakuro s trust and help stopping Kuuya it s revealed that before the escape Genjimaru had cut the tendons on Sakuya s legs so she couldn t walk thus being unable to escape Hakuro and being the perfect hostage for him The final scene shows Sakuya and the still regressed Kuuya outside However no scene has shown Sakuya having walked at all after she is left with Hakuro This final scene and the scenes with only Sakuya and Kuuya show only the two of them and no third person who could have carried Sakuya So I am wondering if Sakuya ended up being healed at some point or if Kuuya was carrying her all this time >>> utawarerumono
I read that if you complete the harder difficulties you get of the last CG I ve seen both on the internet one I think is Aruru while the other is Eruru as a Shine Maiden I am wondering if these CG are just rewards or if they are connected to extra scenes that play out at the end >>> utawarerumono

Hashirama Senju was the legendary ninja in the world of Naruto he was also the only one who managed to defeat Madara Uchiha How come Hashirama could not break the seal of Edo Tensei when Orochimaru who was less proficient in Edo Tensei than Kabuto later on much like Madara did with Kabuto It seems silly that Hashirama who was stronger than Madara could not break Orochimaru s seal while Madara was able to break Kabuto s more powerful seal >>> naruto

Who is actually the strongest Hokage It would be such a simple question and answer if Kishimoto just gave us a direct answer But instead Kishimoto feeds us different information along the way as the story progresses Pre Chuunin Exam Sarutobi was highlighted as the genius Shinobi The manga stated that he quickly surpassed both the first and the second at a young age and was widely known as the Professor We also find out later that the first and second died in war while the third and fourth sacrificed their lives to use the demon god Chuunin exam era beginning of Shippuden Minato was considered the strongest Hokage Recall when Orochimaru was using Edo Tensei to revive all dead Kages Sarutobi was most afraid of the Fourth For a while everyone regarded the th as the strongest shinobi I am not sure if this is because they never witnessed the first but it seems evident that Minato was the powerhouse Everyone kept saying If the fourth was here Orochimaru would be no problem etc Late Shippuden when Tobi starts acting and Madara is revealed Hashirama is the God of Shinobi He is depicted as the strongest of all four even recognized by Minato He is the only one to resist Orochimaru s control Madara Uchiha also regards everyone else aside from Hashirama as insignificant The thing that bothers me the most is how Sarutobi was not worried and was able to handle fighting both Hashirama and Tobirama Minato was the source of his fear And then later on Hashirama just seems like he is on another level So I guess I have to redefine my question Was Hashirama always the strongest Hokage or did Kishimoto develop his strength later on Or can this just not be determined >>> naruto

In the Visual Novel Amaranto one of the members of Triad is Troy I m playing the English patch of it now and they refer to Troy as a she When they say Troy s name it does sound exactly like they ve translated it However I m confused about whether this is a translation error or not Points that indicate that Troy could be a girl All characters that are in the story or mentioned but two are girls the two guys being a nameless vagrant that Mio was about to kill and the strawberry loving owner of the cafe Yuuki s group hangs out in It s noted that Queen hates men even going so far as to kill most of them off when she takes over a Sect and since the Triad are like her elite guard she would have nothing but girls in it The twins joke about how Troy only has eyes for Senpai which refers to Ria since all the relationships shown possible are Shoujo Ai female female So this would be the same with Troy and Ria Points that indicate that Troy could be a boy Troy is a guy s name at least in English in Japanese it s pronounced as to ro i however in the game it seemed to be pronounced as to ro i a so the English name may be a mistranslation Troy s appearance Troy sounds like a boy but that could mean little So I am wondering is Troy a girl or is Troy actually a boy and the translation is wrong >>> amaranto

I remember watching an anime on Toonami years ago with a main character whose sword could change form depending on the needs of his current battle The sword used these gem like balls roughly the size of a ball bearing to empower itself I can remember two forms distinctly one was a green longsword that let him cut through the opponents mastery over nature wind and lightning mostly One turned him into a speedster but I can t remember much about the enemy he fought that time The main character was trying to protect a girl who was some kind of experiment or was experimented on The elemental using enemy had previously tried to kill her by firing lightning into her mouth >>> identification-request
I am confused about the Steins Gate world line As stated in the wiki the Steins Gate world line is in the Beta attractor field In the Beta attractor field the final convergent point is World War However in Steins Gate they prevent WW by making sure the thesis will be destroyed If Steins Gate is in the Beta attractor field wouldn t it lead to WW If WW doesn t happen shouldn t Steins Gate be in another attractor field >>> steins-gate
In the anime under the pretext of sending a D mail that asks her to change her phone Moeka sends herself the location of the IBN the shrine Her past self then steals the IBN from the shrine Okabe tries to undo this by sending a message along the lines of Shrine is a trap Don t go there from her phone However it is stated that she didn t believe that message and stole the IBN from the shrine Okabe then concludes that in order for her to believe the message it must come from FB My question is why would Moeka believe the first message but not the second sent by Okabe Both the messages were sent from the same phone so why believe one but not the other >>> steins-gate
When the time machine crash occurs the time machine is damaged because John Titor didn t calculate the co ordinates correctly so she can t travel back in time ergo Okabe can t go with her and thus he can t scream But in case of screaming it was Okabe who went back in time so the time machine landed correctly ergo no crash happened Despite this the first episode shows both of them happening same day Aren t these two events contradicting each other >>> steins-gate
On the mini series in Manga Enel goes to the moon It s a side story titled Enel s Great Space Operations But I m wondering how can he reach the moon First he goes to space where there is no air how can he breath Second it s a really long distance the distance between earth and moon is km miles And considering that One Piece takes place in the sixteenth century the average speed of a ship at that time was less than knot kph mph it will take more than years to reach the moon with a ship like that Third can t he just use his power to reach the moon I don t know if lightning can go through space or not maybe Kizaru can do it better >>> one-piece

Saiga and Suitengu both contracted the virus when the Research Lab that Suitengu s team was sent to infiltrate blew up Since almost all the other Euphorics wouldn t have had anything to do with the infiltration mission and Suitengu mentions in the nd episode that the Piano Teacher would get more arms because of supposed deaths from people trying to become Euphorics indicating that not everyone who came in contact with Kugura had the virus i am wondering how did the other Euphorics get the virus >>> speed-grapher
In order for the Euphoria Virus to activate the virus carrier has to come in contact with an enzyme which can be found in Kagura s bodily fluids which can probably be assumed to be always through a kiss Even though Suitengu saw Kagura as his sister Yui in a trance Kagura probably didn t do anything more than kiss However Suitengu is shown to have become a Euphoric after he was operated on So I am wondering did his Euphoria Virus become active because he had Kagura s father s arm or was it through some other means that his virus became active >>> speed-grapher
When Suitengu was explaining to Kamiya how he had already found his sister and she had been with him all this time in the form of a charred bone fragment left from her ashes it s shown that Suitengu found out that Yui has been sold as a prostitute and had become broken after years of abuse When she saw Suitengu she started begging him for money and started to suck on his fingers Suitengu wept a tear of blood which she swallowed before he hugged her It s obvious that Suitengu used his power to put Yui to rest while they were hugging As Yui died she was smiling I am wondering was she smiling because she realized the man hugging her was her older bother or was she happy that she was freed from her life as a prostitute >>> speed-grapher
Some are quite obvious ie Saiga s desire to capture life in his camera Katsuya Shirogane s desire to be as flexible as rubber Kamiya s desire for food However others it s not so obvious like Father Kanda having the power to control lighting and Ran Yurigaoka s power to make his tattoos come to life seems to conflict with his pride of having perfect skin So i am wondering what each of the Euphoric s desire was that allowed their powers to manifest >>> speed-grapher
During Suitengu s flashback of his childhood he finds both his parents have hanged themselves however when Kamiya see them he almost acts as if he was expecting it plus there was his timing arriving at the mansion One of the requirements for membership of the Roppongi Club was that a member had life insurances so that if a member couldn t pay what they owe they could get killed and the insurances collected we see in the episode where Suitengu s music box breaks that the guy who couldn t pay was hanged to make look like it was a suicide I am wondering was Suitengu s Parents murdered and if so was it by the Tennzu Group who pushed them into debt >>> speed-grapher
In the st episode as Kagura descends there is an extravagant looking man watching the ceremony In the rd episode after Kagura and Saiga fall into the water he shows up behind Suitengo commenting on Saiga s power and attempting to come up with a name for it Suitengu refers to him as Master I don t remember his name I am wondering who this man was as it seems he was important enough to be focused on during the ceremony and he knew right away Saiga had become a Euphoric >>> speed-grapher

I used to watch Naruto a long time ago and I remember there being a filler anime about people using lightning techniques One thing I remember specifically was that one of the ninjas was using a lightning weapon that was supposed to be able to cut through anything including Chakra The problem was that one of the Ninjas from Hidden Leaf if I remember correctly was fighting them and stopping the blade with a regular Kunai How does that work If the lightning weapon can cut through anything including Chakra why would a regular kunai stop it After a quick research the weapon is the Sword of the Thunder God as stated on Naruto Wikia Sword of the Thunder God Narutopedia the Naruto Encyclopedia Wiki As shown in Aoi s fight with Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha the blade was shown to not only be able to easily cut through any solid object but also through chakra based substances as well After rewatching the episodes again the person using the sword swung at a ninja then a couple of kunais is seen to drop to the floor blocking the attack The Kunais are seen to be intact So if this sword can cut through anything why was his attack stopped by them >>> naruto

I remember watching as a small child an anime movie The images are very vague Some relatively clear elements that I remember A monster that grows and consumes a city slowly The monster used to be a character in the movie The monster was very organic pulsing Not mechanical as far as I remember Fight event scene on an elevated highway that runs through the city Skyscrapers around near it Monster seemed to shoot or grow large parts of itself Like tentacles but with not a lot of ability to use the tentacles Some not sure elements that I remember Possibly a schoolboy maybe bullied There might have been a female character that the boy was friends with I think the monster consumed absorbed people Monster grew by exploding Possibly a military response but that seems like a pretty likely story telling element for something like this I think the boy that was the start of the monster is still visible seen later on as part of the monster The monster protects the female character Maybe protects her from the military response After writing this up I came back and realized that it may also have been an episode of something Though I only remember ever having one of this which seems a bit odd for an episode like story As for the age of the movie AT least years old So early s and prior to that Also as far as I remember I watched it on VHS But this was in a third world country so it was most likely from a video rental store that pirated movies After these many years and only vague memories on the movie I m not entirely sure if what I remember actually happened in the movie or if it s based on my years of watching movies anime and building up parts of the story to fit my memory Hope the info I gave was enough and someone here knows this movie >>> identification-request

Ten years ago I watched an anime movie that took place in a futuristic city and had a main character with a robotic arm I m pretty sure it was an eighties movie and had the word city in the title but it s not Demon City or Wicked City as far as I can tell Can anybody get me on the right path here >>> identification-request
I watched this anime many years ago I think it s been over years by now I watched it on a VHS tape with English dub so yes an old one it s likely to be rated Mature It s probably a movie I only watched a short amount of it I think there are people in a forest and this girl the protagonist shapely pale skinned in her early s is captured by a group of men the antagonists The girl is thrown into a cell grey stone with a flat raised stone bed four stone walls high cut out window bars facing hallway and the leader of the men wants her to talk She refuses so to make her give in they take away her clothes to be supposedly given back when she responds to the interrogation along with keeping her prisoner in the cell The men possibly laugh at her for this They give her a tattered thin vaguely see through blanket as the only thing she can use to cover up keep warm She curls up naked on the stone bed in the cell under her thin piece of fabric blanket There may possibly be fairies in this anime Which would be sympathetic to the girl protagonist also not Tinkerbell sized fairies but human sized Not sure if they re visible to everyone or just the girl If they exist in this anime at all Art style definitely not cute sy Made for older viewers Thanks >>> identification-request

I ve got few clues but nothing much specific To start with the characters I can remember the protagonist being a guy possibly hearing a voice of an unknown girl trapped in another world One of the main characters also was a girl wearing glasses with ability to shift between the worlds I know that when she took the glasses off she became a blood thirsty and unstoppable op in short Also the shift was preceded with some sort of a quake and it all was getting dark with people disappearing and possibly some gravity changes The plot was supposed to be rescuing a girl trapped in that other world Turning out she was the evil one maybe I know it s not much to go by but I ll be really thankful for any guesses >>> identification-request
I found this image today and am curious as to who the character therein is The only English result produced by a reverse image search is this blog post which suggests that the origin is the anime Durarara However I ve been looking at various Durarara character profiles such as the category on their Wikia and this image of all the major characters and this boy does not appear to be in them All this leads me to believe this shot might be a flashback or something as he looks quite a bit younger or perhaps another anime if I ve been misled What is the name of this character >>> durarara

When Dr Tenma visits a comatose Johan in hospital we see a scene where Johan wakes up from coma to ask an existential question which contrasts with this philosophy that life is inherently meaningless Tenma does not answer we cut to a scene where Tenma is panting in a cold sweat over a comatose Johan Which of these interpretations is true Tenma has hallucinated it entirely and Johan has never gained a conscious state much less walked away Johan has indeed woken up and questioned Tenma and later escaped The screenwriter or Manga artist has made this a perfect ambiguity Background The scene seems open to interpretation as I later discovered The contrasting interpretations I infer that Tenma hallucinated this entirely as in the next scene Johan appears to not have ever stirred Tenma feels safe leaving him alone Tenma hallucinated this overcome by understanding the reason for Johan s bitter life philosophy Popular Wikia author quoted below says that there is a possibility that its for real Johan woke up questioned Tenma went back to sleep while Tenma is in a cold sweat then later leaves the building This is supported by the fact that Johan leaves his bed by escape or death as the same article presents this ambiguity proving that he was physically capable of doing so From http obluda wikia com wiki Johan Liebert end of the series Tenma paid Johan a visit in the state police hospital where he had been unconscious ever since the massacre After being informed that he had a name Johan sat up and began talking to Tenma retelling the story of his mother s choice and asking which child wasn t needed It is unclear whether this was a hallucination that Tenma experienced or if it was actually real and His mother s true sentiments while making the switch might have been frightening for Johan leaving him to question the scene for years to come However if that segment is to be interpreted as a hallucination by Tenma this might not be the case >>> monster
In episode of Naruto Shippuden I m in hell when Obito arrives on the battle field he sees how Kakashi killed Rin The wiki summarizes this scene as On his way to the battle site Obito has a vision of Rin through his empty eye socket He arrives just in time to see Kakashi run his Chidori through Rin s chest Rin s death awakens both their Mangeky Sharingan In the next scene we see that the Kiri nin are clearly disappointed by the fact that Kakashi killed Rin one of them says Damn it He did it and another replies After all the trouble we went through to get her But I don t understand why he had to kill her why they couldn t wait e g for reinforcements to arrive Is there some good reason why it was better for her or for the village that she dies rather than to be captured by the Kiri nin >>> naruto

This Edo Tensei looks pretty complicated and annoying since the revived one is immortal and powerful As we ve seen every soul was freed and moved to the afterlife by this I mean normally freed from the jutsu so if someone decides to use again this jutsu could it be possible to bring back again a dead person meaning that until you run out of DNA samplse and vessels you can bring back anyone an infinite time Being an exception I m not reading the manga but unfortunately I know that the Hokage s are revived in case of Hashirama and Tobirama to be the second time BUT they were sealed in the Shinigami so their souls aren t brought back from the pure world again I have no idea about their second arrival please no spoiler just I ve mentioned that they came from somewhere else So for e g could be Itachi brought back again and again with the Edo Tensei or after his first revival and after his soul sealed his soul would be blocked somewhere in the pure world forbidding an another resurrection of that soul >>> naruto

Early into Fate Stay Night there is a scene where Shirou sees Sakura and another man In the Unlimited Blade Works Route we confirm this other man is Gilgamesh When Sakura talks to Shirou she says that the other man was a foreigner and she couldn t understand him However we can see from the image that that may not be the case Since Gilgamesh has been tainted by Angra Mainyu s corruption of the Holy Grail from the previous war and Sakura is a Black Grail Vessel with a deeper connection to Angra Mainyu than the White Grail Vessel Ilya did Gilgamesh already know about Sakura >>> fate-stay-night
In the actual Fate Route after Saber is summoned we see Gilgamesh in casual attire when he confronts Saber and Shirou before getting into his golden armour However in Unlimited Blade Works and before the start of the Fate Route his casual attire is different particularly his hair and that he s not wearing earrings left Unlimited Blade Works right Fate Now I can understand that in Unlimited Blade Works the reason he doesn t wear his armour when fighting Shirou in the end is in part due to his ego in thinking he won t need it on someone like Shirou However I don t think it s his ego which is the cause of his change in appearance So I am wondering why does Gilgamesh s casual appearance look different in these two routes considering his Unlimited Blade Works appearance was also seen when he was talking to Sakura >>> fate-stay-night

As a former Shotokan Karate practitioner myself I am quite familiar with the Heian Kata series However I have never heard of Heian Hyakudan before First and foremost is this a real technique or kata I ve been trying to find out more about Heian Hyakudan through google searches but I get absolutely nothing If we dissect his finishing stance we might be able to come closer to a conclusion His bottom section leg and hip formation is a posture held after jumping or leaping We also know he is landing from a jump due to his forward shoulder being lower than the back shoulder as well as the visual landing effect The part that throws me off the most is his upper posture Normally when a jumping technique is executed both arms work together and are connected katas Heian Godan and Bassai Dai In this picture his left arm is back which would mean that his technique requires a certain hip motion The only times I recall seeing the top posture is in a Kata like Chinte but even then the leg stance requires feet to be spread out with open or reverse hips The top just doesn t match with the bottom I have never seen a technique like this nor heard of it Please help me identify this specific technique or Heian Hyakudan >>> kenichi

Please forgive me my somewhat lengthy preface here At best I have to estimate that this anime was aired at least years ago I don t recall it being part of a series so I m fairly certain it was a one shot movie Never can be sure though All I can really provide for identification purposes is a small handful of scenes I am unsure if these are all even from a single anime It may well be different ones that my memories have somehow merged to form a full concept Hopefully someone will recognize at least one of these scenes otherwise I ll need to find some way to wipe these things from my memory and forget they ever existed Scene Takes place on a star ship A tall alien with a disc like head At some point the monsters head detaches from its body and begins to fly around independently That is all I can recall from it Scene Takes place on a planet near some teleporters A woman is fighting the alien hears a voice her brothers telling her to use or run to the teleporter It later turns out to be a recording There was some emotional connection between the woman and whoever s voice it was During the fight the monster gets caught in an explosion and blown into a building one of the teleporters I think It walks out of rubble with something impaling its head It doesn t appear particularly phased but woman seems to make special note of the injury as though it was somehow unexpected Scene The woman older male and youger male possibly a child are driving in a tunnel or under a bridge or just some dense cityscape I just recall the environment being very crowded At some point they run into quadripedal monsters of some sort and wind up running a test one one determining that it is somehow related to the main antagonist Scene The main antagonist alien monster appears to have placed a beacon for some reason it strikes me that the beacon was organic in nature on the roof of a building to start calling in more of its kind from off world Scene Takes place in a desert setting The woman confronts the monster The woman has a staff of some sort it was shown earlier in the movie I believe by the younger boy When the tip of the staff is pressed into the ground it generates a forcefield that surrounds the staff and its user the tip is pressed into the monster causing the force field to cut the creature in half horizontally The top half falls towards the woman and the face of the monster extends from the head to attack her It turns out the things neck was its only weakness As it is falling someone I believe at this point backup had arrived takes a blade and cuts into the things neck and then slices it down length wise cutting the face in half too If any part of these scenes can be used to identify an anime I would be beyond greatful to know my mind wasn t playing tricks on me >>> identification-request

I am curious as to why Villagulio was angry at Muginami for taking the Vox in the first season The scenes after that hint that Villagulio was forced to do so but it didn t say why Villagulio article on the anime s wiki says that he did so in order for Muginami to get close to the others Soon after he formed the rebellious organization Kiss and sent Muginami to Kamogawa to investigate about the Voxes but apparently gets angry at her for becoming the pilot of Vox Ignis and abandons her while actually it was part of his plan to have her get close to Madoka and the others However the wiki doesn t look that trustworthy to me >>> rinne-no-lagrange

OK so the other day I got to a discussion with my mate about the Remake of Evangelion and Evangelion in general And he seams to be under the impression that the new Evangelion movies are not actually a remake but a sequel And he does have good arguments backing it The idea being that the Evengelion You are not alone world is the world that Shinji created at the end of The End of Evangelion If you think about it it does fit One of the biggest hints for this is the same red sea seen with what the The End of Evangelion ends and Evangelion begins More to the point if you remember the original series then there the sea was blue and in the remake it s red and if you think about the big differences than it does make seance But I just do not know I kinda am convinced but at the same time are they really trolling with us Kinda hard to believe I would love to give counter arguments but can t really think of any because he is claiming that the world that was created by Shinji was almost identical but with some minor differences >>> neon-genesis-evangelion

From my understanding throughout the whole anime series the touge rules has been one of the following Cat and Mouse Sudden Death using Wikipedia Tge terminology Cars start bumper to bumper if cat finishes a round ahead of the rat with a considerable time difference cat wins If rat overtakes the cat rat wins If neither happen proceed to a new round and swap positions Example When Keisuke beat Wataru on Shomaru pass Grip Gambler Cars start side by side or rolling start up to first turn whoever is leader at the end wins Example When Takumi raced Keisuke at Akina pass When Project D raced Purple Shadow both Takumi and Keisuke s races started bumper to bumper indicating that it wasn t grip gambler However in both cases they were overtaken at one point and the race didn t end meaning it wasn t cat and mouse sudden death Perhaps there s a non sudden death version of cat and mouse which would make a lot more sense as both races went into multiple rounds However there is still something not quite right In Takumi s case he overtook his opponent back and prolonged the race In Keisuke s case he overtook his opponent back and the race ended with no noticeable winning distance What was different between Keisuke and Takumi s race so that Keisuke won Keisuke regained his lead but that should have taken it into the next round Even Keisuke himself said That felt kind of questionable Want to go for a third run So overall I am beyond confused Exactly what Touge race rules did they race in >>> initial-d

I ve noticed recently that most animes from to recent use different art styles during their OP and ED when compared to the main story From a non artistic standpoint I can understand that since the same OP or ED is used for a large number of episodes that they can put more details into them and other aspects without having to spend a lot of time on it It s done once and used from then on I also understand that some use Retro styles just because they can and it makes you laugh This question is for the in between styles They look similar but it is obvious that it was done Differently BUT the difference is sometimes so drastic that you can t even tell they belong together Characters end up with such different looks that it takes you a moment to comprehend what is going on While I do not find it a bad thing I feel that the work and detail put into the ED and OP could have also been placed into the story and made a world of difference My most current example Chocotto Sister and its ED It is a show but the ED animation would have put it in the or category in my mind It has that much of a difference This question refers to OP and EDs with movement not static images Be aware Chocotto Sister has topless scenes Please be wary if reviewing an episode NSFW >>> anime-history

In the Fullmetal Alchemist manga anime we learn that alchemists must obey three rules Do not oppose the military Do the transmute gold Do not do human transmutation Moreover at one point in the early manga probably chapter according to Wikipedia we see Ed transmute what appears to be gold from rocks when he is duping Yoki into selling him rights to Youswell However in the context of my question below this might also be attributed to early installment weirdness since in the corresponding episode in the anime episode I think we see Ed giving Yoki rocks that have been coated with gold from coins Ed got from Yoki Both of the above seem to imply that transmuting gold is possible in the FMA universe yet this seems to be contradictory given some other manga details In the first chapter we learn from Al that with alchemy one can only transmute like from like Being me I read this to imply that the sort of conservation of mass alluded to when chemical equations are balanced generally applies in terms of what alchemy can do the FMA universe at least in the more practical mundane examples we see in the manga On a second read I m really not sure if that s a correct interpretation Thus is transmuting gold actually taken to be something possible in the FMA universe or is it even possible to come to a conclusion about this >>> fullmetal-alchemist

Im looking this manga anime that have been driving me crazy the first of which i havent seen in over a year or so the other a few months and i cant remember the name of either ill try to describe it as well as i can remember it was a fantasy mmo style one with the main character being a mage whos goal was to be a master grand mage something about people maxing out there class and then multiclassing and maxing that out he might have been the first to master classes or something along those lines i believe there was a supporting character that tried to make a ninja or ranger class i believe he kept changing his name alpha gamma so on i believe the half way point was them finding out the game they were playing was only a beta and something about another company trying to fuse a less popular mmo with that one it is similar to SAO though the charcters were able to log out and the main character went to a VR cafe for it and the support was the clerk there there was also another part where he played some shooting mmo and beat someone from the fantasy one or something along those lines if im not mistaken there was also something about a him liking a NPC which turned out to be a real person hooked up to the game i hope you can help me out mates its been driving me nuts trying to find it >>> identification-request

In the story of the manga it is said that after Ei Sei escaped Zhao and eventually rescued by Qin troops the King became aware of his escape minutes right after they exited the last gate sending Zhao s cavalry to search for him Everyone but Sei died and even then had to be rescued almost at the end of the way If they went through all this trouble to just get Ei Sei it is only strongly implied that Sei s mother who hadn t been rescued would be in grave danger probably geting killed some time soon since Sei s Zhao pursuers at some point mentioned that it didn t matter if they captured Sei dead or alive and if not heavily watched and or tortured and disgraced more harshly that she had been before since people s logic of those times was so flawed that they would go so far as to blame some innocent person from a nation for the crimes of some other person from the same nation Having said that I am wondering how the hell did she get out from Zhao seeing as Sei s initially unnoticed escape was barely possible But having read until chapter yet another question arises in my head If Sei and his mother hated each other so much she tried to kill him why on earth was she rescued in the first place to begin with A thorough explanation on this would be great and would stop me from having to open a new question Aside from this comes a question that might be considered off topic but I ll ask it anyway just in case Is there any similar real life historic records chronicling how Lady Zhao somehow moved from Zhao to Qin I ve done a quick read of Wikipedia and seem to not find anything however I will keep on researching and update this if I find the answer on my own >>> kingdom

When the winner of the Idol festival is revealed Shiraki comes up to Hayasaka and says they won The disgusted face on Hayasaka is priceless This is right after the announcement that the winners are Akamiso All Stars While their performance is not shown we can clearly see that the crowd is rather normal But on WUG s peformance the whole stadium comes down We have a scene right before the result is announced where Shiraki does a kind of power walk from the judge s booth and the judges sound REALLY nervous only to be berated by Hayasaka What really happened is not stated but we have two scenarios WUG won but Shiraki rigged the results The judges really chose Akamiso All Stars perhaps because of Yoshino missed jump I really think that scenario is the most likely because a it tells a better story b explains screenshot scenario leaves that comment floating on a void c is really on par with Shiraki s ruthless and unscrupulous persona d is a way for Shiraki to strike at the same time both Mayu and Hayasaka for her daring to step on stage again and for his betrayal on mentoring WUG For scenario a judges be judges and a missed jump can cost a medal So without any further ADO and before the flag hunters cry WOLF Is there any official canonical reference that Shiraki rigged the Idol Festival results >>> wake-up-girls

There s an anime I ve had trouble finding out on for the longest time I first came across it on a streaming server via ShoutCast it was fansubbed and now I want to know more about it because it was actually interesting and maybe I can find a DVD or something It had to be before possibly before which is around the time I started college maybe after because I remember being still a teenager and trying to get into anime that wasn t available in my country I couldn t tell if it was an OVA or a full blown series but the animation quality was so good that it almost completely resembled Little Witch Academia but it s not LWA When LWA did come out though I thought it was that anime I came across years back but was bummed out to realize it wasn t One of its distinctive moments that described the particular universe was having a separate world for witches and one of the witch girls told another girl that going to the mundane human modern world was a terrible place to be in because there wasn t any magic apparently it was also terrible because the idea of marriage was also terrible to them I think there were some giant spiders and or monsters and a large forest setting involved The colors were a bit vibrant but not blinding in your face It was slightly neutral ish and the tone of the overall show seemed a bit dark but not gritty at least not for that particular episode scene I watched >>> identification-request
In the recent naruto chapter The Sage of Six paths told naruto that he was the reincarnation of Ashura and Sasuke was the reincarnation of Indra But then he also mentioned that the previous reincarnations were hashirama and madara Now that Madara is alive whose soul does he have Because indra s soul is inside Sasuke Is there something that I ve missed >>> naruto
From the current chapters of Naruto it is revealed that Rikudou Sennin has a brother who also sealed the juubi in himself That means there are two juubis in the world If Madara has had control of one of them where could the other be hidden His presence in the world for now is speculation But as the Rabbit Goddess had Byakugan this could mean that this brother may have been the Hyuuga s ancestor which would mean Senju Uchiha and Hyuuga are indeed related but Hyuuga and Uchiha could never be able to use the other s doujutsu because of difference in ancestor So in essence I m asking where could the second Juubi presumably be is it not possible that the brother is the Hyuuga ancestor For now this is all speculation but I have a feeling that Kishimoto will end this series with a few plot holes so I want to see other users ideas on these questions >>> naruto
Lately I cant help but notice that lalot of the names of characters and techniques used in naruto seem to be derived from folklore and or based on gods and the likes Some samples would be Izanagi a deity born of the seven divine generations in Japanese mythology and Shinto Jiraiya originally known as Ogata Shuma Hiroyuki is the title character of the Japanese folk tale Jiraiya Gketsu Monogatari So why are so many of the names used in Naruto derived from such things And is this only common in Naruto or does it happen in other series aswell >>> naruto culture

I don t understand exactly how they work I ve got the basics but I want to know the details Simply put a Demon Weapon is a person who can transform into a weapon Alone they aren t much of a threat but paired with a Weapon Meister the two are very powerful But later in the Soul Eater series we see how some Weapons and Meisters pose a serious threat on their own but they look trained and experienced so it seems to be more of a guideline In the first few episodes there s talk about soul ritual where a Demon Weapon has to consume Kishin eggs and witch soul The Weapon is supposed to level up after that somehow and the effects of that aren t very clear to me The only thing that hints at the magnitude of such upgrade is that Death uses Maka s father as his weapon him being a Death Weapon It s like the two most powerful guys in the show together yet not much is apparent about how it affects their power both Meister and Weapon Also we see some Meisters teamed up with more than one Weapon They can resonate their souls and it somehow works for them It seems this is kind of the same as multiple Weapon Meister combos resonating all of their souls together But what about combos with only Weapons and only Meisters Would that work I m also confused about how a basic Weapon and an upgraded one should be called Are they Demon Weapons or Death Weapons What does completing this soul ritual do for Weapon and Meister What about combos with Weapon and Meisters What are the basic and upgraded Weapons called Soul Eater Not just started airing possibly shedding more light on the mechanics of that world but I guess the answers to these questions can be found in Soul Eater >>> soul-eater

The very first scene of the F SN visual novel even before the prologue from Rin s perspective has Shirou experiencing the fire that occurred at the end of the Fourth Grail War blacking out and then waking up in a hospital with Kiritsugu by his side There Kiritsugu identifies himself to Shirou as a mahoutsukai that is one who uses mahou Depending on what translation you ve seen mahou is translated as Sorcery Magic or True Magic by contrast with the lesser majutsu which is Magic Thaumaturgy or Magecraft The point here is that mahou is the greater of the two arts available to beings like Zelretch while majutsu is the lesser and is what is used by ordinary people like Kiritsugu Kotomine and so forth Why does Kiritsugu call himself a mahoutsukai As far as I know Kiritsugu never actually attained the ability to perform mahou what with the whole him destroying the Grail and all of that I apologize for using Japanese terms here but the utter inability of Nasuverse translators to be consistent with one another about terminology leaves me no choice >>> fate-stay-night

So to my understanding the idea of alchemy is equivalent exchange in which you get in return as much as you gave This doesn t make sense to me as in the beginning when they tried to transmute their mother back Alphonse lost everything and Edward lost his leg They didn t get anything in return or at least anything worth of a soul and a body After this Edward transmuted his arm to get Alphonse back So put in a calculation Things lost Random piled ingredients which were supposed to compose the average human Alphonse s body Alphonse s soul Edward s arm Edward s leg Things gained A blob of purple stuff with Alphonse s soul affixed to it for a while Alphonse s soul So where the hell did the rest of the stuff go And more importantly why could they not just have transmuted everything back >>> fullmetal-alchemist
If been re watching some Gintama episodes and noticed the parasitic mushrooms in some episode Which started to grow on their head and slowly take them over I also came across the pokemon Paras to which something pretty similar happens While Paras symbiotic relationship with the mushrooms on its back isn t exactly normal it is beneficial for both Paras feeds the mushrooms with its body and the fungus provides additional means of defense Exactly how much control the mushrooms can exert over the Pokemon isn t clear but odd goes to disturbing when Paras evolves into Parasect It s hard to say exactly what change takes place at Level but for some reason the mushrooms take their chance and merge into a single organism taking over the Paras in the process With heightened aggression and a pair of zombified milky eyes anything cute or endearing about Paras is replaced by a demonic drone known as Parasect So now my question where does the parasitic mushroom come from Is this made up in anime or like allot of other anime components based on some kind of folk lore >>> tropes

I have yet to find a clear answer to this question From what I ve read it may be an art house series about dangers of remote communication phobia of technological advancement and feeling of insecurity The last point I can agree with because of how easily information can be accessed with the use if internet these days but the rest I think there s a more concrete meaning to this series SEL is a series with very unusual direction and a peculiar artistic style These traits are commonly seen in art house works that may not bear any specific message Throughout the series we learn about the difficult reality surrounding Lain her relatives are troubled some of her friends have psychological problems there are suicides happening in mystical circumstances and then there are some secret agents following around Later in the series things become rather surreal and Lain turns into some kind of god of the Net I ve never understood this portion of the anime and what it could possibly suggest Does it warn us about dangers of becoming too self important Does it mean it s possible to lose the sense of reality when using internet Or maybe Lain s character is a metaphor for a person new to technological advancements of today What is the message the authors of SEL are trying to communicate >>> serial-experiments-lain

There is a break in the story both in the Manga and the Anime that fans will be familiar with Manga chapter The Fish Gaze or Anime episode One eyed fish In it the youth of Ginko is shown and where the origin of his missing eye and white hair is explained One thing which has bugged me a bit is the ominous prophecy attached to it Nui Ginko s de facto mentor rescuer tells him that the fish in a local pond and herself only have one eye since they got exposed too much to the silver light created by a very powerful mushi which she calls Ginko a huge silver fish Nui notes that those who lose both eyes to it get turned into a mushi themselves called Tokoyami Nui also mentions that she performed experiments on fish who had already lost an eye which showed that once they had lost an eye they would invariably lose the other and turn into Tokoyami even if never exposed to the silver light again Later in the story Ginko the main character not the Mushi loses an eye as well Therefore Does this mean that Ginko s death is certain and unavoidable >>> mushishi

I hope you can help me identify this movie I watched around years ago The animation looks somewhat similar to that of Memories Magnetic Rose The word Brother or Brothers is somewhere in the title I think That s probably because the story revolves around two brothers the protagonist kind of chubby with dark skin and long black hair the other brother is tall and bearded The story is set in Ancient Rome or Greece I think it s Rome because I remember there s a crucifixion or an attempt of a crucifixion almost at the end of the movie That s all I remember I know it s a long shot but surely something most come to mind Thanks >>> identification-request

From the start of the series we saw tailed beasts as large vicious and angry animals bound inside the body of a jinchuriki They were shown to despise the humans who bound them and used their power for personal gain But they weren t always like this Initially they were small and showed emotion towards the Sage of Six Paths While I understand why they hate humans now I don t understand why and how they grew up from their baby size to adult size They are a mass of large chakra When they die they are formed again Also as we have seen when Kyuubi was divided into two separate parts his size was reduced But that reduction in chakra didn t make him small again So can anyone explain How can Tailed Beasts grow up like normal animals from chibis to adult animals Also do chibi Tailed Beasts have less power and chakra than their adult forms >>> naruto

In the penultimate episode of Puella Magi Madoka Magica we briefly see this image possibly formed by the ice in a glass of alcohol when Madoka s mother is at the bar with Madoka s teacher This image comes right before a break from that scene before the episode shifts back to Homura s room so it s hard to tell While initially that seemed like a reasonable interpretation to me in retrospect the two blades here suggest that this isn t the case and that the image is superimposed onto something else This clearly seems to be one of the more famous details from Michelangelo s The Creation of Adam which is on the Sistine Chapel ceiling What is the significance of this image in the context of the anime series With other references in the series there s often a clearer connection e g to Goethe s Faust but here it doesn t seem as obvious and the only interpretation I can think of is related to Madoka becoming some sort of god but even so using this specific reference doesn t seem to make much sense here >>> madoka-magica symbolism

I am looking for an anime that had recently came out maybe in the middle of last month I watched this maybe around that time but I cannot find it again and had accidentally cleared my history on Firefox The synopsis of the story goes like this A young girl with perhaps maybe long hear probably really noticeable eyes is carrying a large coffin which contains a magical weapon gun presumably similar to perhaps weapons in the RWBY universe This girl is the daughter of a emperor who ruled the world in fear or tyranny or both In episode one from what I remember she runs into this boy who uses some type of hunter magic He has a sister who also uses this same type of magic From what I remember this girl runs into him as she was crawling around behind bushes trying to make her way to a town When this boy decides to help her they are attacked by a deer antelope which she eventually kills Later on she buys this boy that helped her lunch It so happened to be owned by his own sister who destroys some tables in an attempt to maybe hurt him seriously for not helping out The girl with the coffin eventually hires them soon after for a job but doesn t reveal what it is she is looking for Later on in the episode she raids a general or very powerful adversary who was there during the battle which defeated her father I also remember that the boy she runs into comes along with her including his sister Eventually both brother and sister encounter this man who has the ability to control anything inside his mansion at will and maybe has physic powers too It may help but they refer to this adversary as a real mage which would indicate that they may not be actual mages at all but use some type of borrowed magic At the end of the episode it is revealed that what she was after was her fathers body parts so she could give him a proper burial The part of her father they obtained in question was the left or right hand of her father Before they leave the raided mansion the man insists that it is a source of great power assumes that they want to sell it and in desperation is willing to pay anything to get it back Please note that this desperate adversary was soundly defeated after the hand item was taken out of this vault After this happened he could not call upon his physic powers It also was apparent that the hand powered the mansion and his magic potentially Finally all I can remember is that after the successful heist on the mansion they are encountered by a group that wants to prevent the worlds destruction They are then tailed by them in a truck and eventually escape in mist >>> identification-request

In the Monogatari Series there are a lot apparitions The ones that can easily recognized as corresponding to actual stories in real life are the phoenix Araragi Tsuhiki and vampire Araragi Koyomi Oshino Shinobu What about the others Here s a list of apparition that appear so far in anime Crab God Senjougahara Hitagi Lost Cow Snail Hachikuji Mayoi Monkey Paw Rainy Devil Kanbaru Suruga Snake God Sengoku Nadeko Flame Wreath Bee Araragi Karen Black Hanekawa Hanekawa Tsubasa In the case of Hanekawa they said that it s a new kind of apparition Are all of them based on apparitions in real life stories >>> monogatari-series
In the first episode of To Aru Majutsu no Index Misaka attacks Touma with her Railgun but she deliberately misses him After that she attacks him with her usual lighting attack but he nullifies it with his power But why did Mikoto attack him It s so unlike her to attack somebody that innocent Yes she does always attack some people but they usually pick a fight with her first >>> toaru-majutsu-no-index
In Witch Craft Works I have heard the term contract thrown around quite a bit A contract seems to be able to be made with a town or even with a person So what exactly is it Are there any benefits to a contract Is there a limit to how many contracts you make Can a contract be made with anything else besides a town or a person The term contract seems to be something that can protect non magical people or grant invisibility to someone as long as they are near I am not sure on this in Witch Craft Works So what is a contract I am not sure if this even is correct since the wikia is still under construction and doesn t give any information >>> witch-craft-works

Note I have pretty much never watched any of the Doraemon series seriously I have however read some of the manga that was translated into English and seen quite a number of episodes from what I believe was the anime and possibly some of the movies It seems reasonably clear that many of the people in Nobita s world who he interacts with regularly know of Doraemon s existence and his tools given that Doraemon regularly interacts with Nobita s friends The same might be said of Nobita s parents though I don t really remember that well enough to know for sure However is there any indication that these people also know of Doraemon s exact origin or something less exact but similar such as the fact that he was sent from the future or is this sort of thing simply brushed aside in some fashion In other words does Doraemon ever introduce himself to anyone besides Nobita and if so how does he do so and approximately when does this happen >>> doraemon

Looking back on Bakemonogatari and Nisemonogatari it seems that Koyomi is really weak compared to all of the oddities he faces Suruga s monkey form easily defeats him even though his power was temporarily boosted The snakes in Nadeko snake would have killed him had Kanbaru not intervened he needed to be saved from Black Hanekawa by Shinobu In the latest episode he would probably have died if Yozuru had decided to prolong the fight This is in spite of him getting the largest power up yet from Shinobu Considering that he once told his sisters that The first requirement of being a hero is to be strong and the they re fakes given their lack of strength it seems odd that Koyomi is so underpowered compared to the oddities he faces Does he ever get stronger in later episodes or in the Light Novels >>> monogatari-series

I was wondering in the anime on the th episode Bloody History they refer to some period of time called the Dark Age I was wondering maybe the people that can read the original Japanese Novel can respond this better what exactly was meant by the Dark Age I tried to figure what the Dark age was and while searching for that answer I approximately transcribed from the subbed english version when the False Minoshiro talks about that In that scene he approximately says The turning point for Japan was when Boy A committed a series of crimes He realized he could use his PK powers and open the most difficult of locks A broke into the bedrooms of sleeping women assaulted them and eventually killed them At this point Saki and her friends couldnt comprehend how a human was capable of killing other humans Even after his arrest people continued to use PK to commit crimes It became a weapon for terrorists It split society into a complex mix of opposing political humanitarian and ideological factions and the world entered an era of war unlike any known before Ironically the constant threat to the lives of PK users led to a dramatic evolution of their abilities Meanwhile the human population plummeted worldwide until it was less than of what it itd been at its height These events serve as an overview of the Dark Ages that lasted five centuries From that I concluded that around A D society was something very similar to what we have now with cars iPhones airplanes and normal technology Then people with PK caused a war and for that reason human population suffered a terrible decrease to Then this era lead to a war and then to an era where northeastern Asia divided itself into four distinct and irreconcilable units st Slave Dynasties Where PK users controlled those without PK capabilities nd non PK users who escaped the Dynasties and lived as hunter gatherers rd Bandits who used PK to attack other settlements th a group of those who managed to preserve some remnants of the technological age Then we have the present time where Saki and the others live My question is which time period does the Dark Age correspond to Is the following time scale correct Or is the Dark age before the dynasties division of asia age Also what is known about the dark age >>> from-the-new-world
In sixth volume in last chapter it shows that Doraemon goes to the future and didn t come back again The chapter shows how Nobita trying his best to do anything without Doraemon he got beaten with Giant and still refuse to call Doraemon Doraemon find him still fighting Giant and help him to get home It end with Nobita looking at his desk where Doraemon come at the first time through his drawer His drawer become a regular drawer without Doraemon s Time Machine This is the picture of that chapter With that it looks like Doraemon is supposed to end at volume But we know that it didn t happen because it still continue and they didn t make an ending for Doraemon So is Doraemon manga series are suppose to end at sixth volume or it just another story from Doraemon >>> doraemon
In episode of Nisemonogatari we briefly see Araragi Karen drawn like this This looked a lot like some anime or possibly a character from an anime or manga I d seen within the last ten years or so while in Asia so I have the feeling this drawing style was supposed to allude to something Possibly Dr Slump I m not sure since I don t think I ever saw the anime and I could easily have mixed it up with something else That said this also looks generic enough that s possible that this is only a shift in drawing style But then right before this image there s a drawing of Karen that looked like to me anyway I have a feeling I m wrong about this an imitation of the titular character of Chibi Maruko chan so I m not sure Moreover I remember seeing something that looked very much like a parody of Peko chan in an earlier episode though unfortunately I don t remember which one it was Is this the first image I mean supposed to be an allusion to some other anime series and if so what is it referring to >>> identification-request monogatari-series

I am looking for a Yaoi anime I had watched two or three months ago that I have been unable to find again It is most likely an OVA and probably didn t come out till around the time Senkaiichi Hatsukoi came out So the year it came out is perhaps The OVA revolves around a student proabably who falls in love with his room mate friend but because of his room mates attitudes towards gay people his love has been one sided for years The first OVA starts of with the the guy who has fallen for his senior admitting his love for him Although he does not receive a response from him they were able to continue with their normal day to day relationship inside of this university college From the looks of it they were regularly working in a lab and seemed to get along really well even after the confession In the OVA it had been a year he had admitted his love for him but had still not received any word from him although they saw each other everyday talked regularly and worked together in school He started to think that he had forgotten about it all Eventually in the OVA he is at a bar and his friend gives him a bottle of what looks like wine that makes even the most rigid of people get turned on because he felt sorry for how little there relationship had been going Although he declined several times and even thought about throwing it away he ended up taking it back to his apartment but still not willing to use it on the person he admitted his love too he hides it in a cupboard Later on that night they both get drunk but because the other guy drunk all of the beer he ends up going to the store to buy some more beer However as he is away his room mate rummages through all his stuff and accidentally mistakes the bottle as beer He was looking through all the draws as he was becoming impatient waiting for him to buy more beer When he gets home and finds out he drunk it he becomes quite nervous and quite anxious when he found out that the bottle that he was hiding was drunken However the wine he had been given didn t seem to display any side effects which made him think it was a fake but was eventually proven wrong after they wake up a couple hours later in the night after falling asleep from drinking Hours later the guy who drunk the bottle wakes up and then becomes almost paralyzed and can t walk He falls over and wakes the guy who had admitted his love to him After that he realizes that the wine actually worked He tries to get him up from the floor but then he falls on top of him After that It gets quite explicit >>> identification-request
How did the society where the story of Shin Sekai Yori takes place come to be i e How did Saki s Society came to existence from the societies of the Dark age I am curious about how Saki s society came to be because in her society there is knowledge about science implied from their knowledge about genes However part of it is also mixed with aspects of less modern societies which makes me want to know how these different aspects came about from previous societies during the Dark age Furthermore there are these creatures called false Minoshiro which seem to be some kind of very advanced bio technology which suggest very advanced technology but their society doesn t really live that way With these different aspects of ancient Japanese societies and much newer societies how did Saki s society came to existence Why does it have this mix of modern technology and more ancient aspects What happened to the previous Dynasties during the dark age Did they combine converge to form the modern society which Saki lives at From which dynasty from the Dark age did they come from and what do we know that explains their present society As a refresher here are some of the dynasties from the dark age st Slave Dynasties Where PK users controlled those without PK capabilities nd non PK users who escaped the Dynasties and lived as hunter gatherers rd Bandits who used PK to attack other settlements th a group of those who managed to preserve some remnants of the technological age >>> from-the-new-world
I was quite curious to know what exactly a false minoshiro is For me they seem to be some kind of bio technology machine or cyborg or something of that sort that has the capability of storing a lot of information The reason I think they are not naturally occurring is because of the way they talk which seems to be similar to machine speech However they also seem to be similar to living beings because the false minoshiro was able to surpass the program denying access to its data in order to be spared by Saki and her friend Basically what exactly are they and where did they come from Is that ever explained in the anime or the novel >>> from-the-new-world

I ve always wondered this but why do anime series titles change so often whenever it gets a new season I mean I understand that the title stays the same for long running series like Bleach or One Piece but why do new seasons for one or two cour anime have slightly different names For example To Aru Kagaku no Railgun To Aru Kagaku no Railgun S Zero no Tsukaima Zero no Tsukaima Futatsuki no Kishi Zero no Tsukaima Princesses no Rondo Zero no Tsukaima F Medaka Box Medaka Box Abnormal Sword Art Online Sword Art Online II Ore no Imouto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai Ore no Imouto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai K On K On I m particularly interested in the last two where the only noticeable difference in the title is a punctuation mark They re all direct sequels so why not just give it the same name as the first season like in American television The source material keeps its name throughout its entire life e g there was never a Naruto Shippuuden manga or a Shakugan no Shana III light novel so why do their anime adaptations get different titles Is there a legal thing in Japan which disallows a production for one season to have the same name as another for clarification purposes Or do the producers whoever chooses the names just want to attract more fans by making a distinction between different seasons Some insight into how the airing of anime works would be much appreciated >>> anime-production

This question is not asking about a course that teaches how to create manga or anime but a curriculum of a course similar to English literature Such course would teach the history and culture of anime and manga by studying representative works of different periods and genres and their cultural and social impact The answer should consider the following No previous manga and anime exposure nor Japanese language required The course should take one or two semesters weeks Each week students should spend hours at school weekly and some additional time doing homework The format of the course should be lectures seminars where lectures take form of presentations by the lecturer and seminars consist of reading watching and analyzing selected works Homework should be just about reading and watching the selected works to prepare for seminars The course would probably be best suited for online education but that should not be a limiting factor for the answer After finishing the course the students should know what anime and manga is where it began and how it become popular have watched and read the most notable examples works in anime and manga not necessarily full series understand different periods genres and styles of both anime and manga catch the obvious references to the anime and manga classics in other tv shows movies and books and graphic novels be able to select manga and anime for themselves that they could read watch and enjoy What format should be given in the answer A syllabus of the course Each week s description should have a title such as History of Manga and Anime or Miyazaki s work and influence and description itself a short paragraph and notable recommended works to read and watch Existing courses The following courses can serve as an inspiration https www coursera org course comics >>> anime-history culture manga-history resources

When Natsu Wendy Happy and Carla went to Edolas they couldn t use magic at first Later Natsu and Wendy were given the X balls to regain their magic usage Yet even without the X balls Exceeds could use their magic This is according to the wiki because they have their Magic located inside of their bodies just like the Mages of Earth Land Presumably this is due to the fact that they are the only beings in Edolas whose Magic is located inside of their bodies just like the Mages of Earth Land If both have their magic located within their bodies then why are only the Exceeds able to use their magic but Mages need those X Balls Also related to this question I was wondering why the Exceeds even lost their magic usage to begin with It was said that they need to have the right mind set to be able to use their magic but when they entered Edolas for the first time they didn t know magic was limited so they were supposed to have the right mind set at that time right So why did they lose their magic usage when they arrived >>> fairy-tail
According to the wiki when a Shinigami dies their remaining lifespan is given to the human they saved Shinigami who die are reduced to dust and their remaining lifespan is given to the human they saved Since Rem killed L and Watari she gained their remaining lifespans Additionally she probably still had some lifespan left On top of that Misa was already given a lot of lifespan from Gelus from which she lost again So does this mean all of this lifespan is transferred to Misa Amane Yet according to her wiki page she dies in at the age of only seven years after Rem died Does this mean that humans are also capable of reducing their own lifespans Or would the author have made a mistake by letting Misa die as early as she has I know she lost of her remaining lifespan through the two eye deals but you d think that the cumulation of L Watari and Rem s remaining lifespans would be greater than just one year wouldn t you >>> death-note

Recall that the anime industry produces TV anime according to a season schedule winter Jan Mar spring Apr Jun summer Jul Sep and fall Oct Dec Since at least and perhaps even before than that there have been consistent differences in the average quality of anime released in each season The details are open to argument but most commentators will agree that spring is consistently the best season of anime in any given year while winter is the worst My personal impression is that on average spring fall summer winter It is not surprising that seasonal trends would exist in Hollywood for example all the big blockbusters come out in the summer and it seems that January and February are off months for the industry or so this article claims The real question though is why What is it about winter that makes it the dumping ground for lousy anime What is it about spring that gets the anime industry to put out good content When I talk about quality here I m basically talking about Rotten Tomatoes ratings an aggregate of opinions from critical reviewers and ordinary consumers Quality may not be objectively measurable but quality as perceived by the consumer certainly is Technical merits of the production e g sakuga sound direction etc are important in this context only insofar as they factor into the Rotten Tomatoes ratings here For ease let s restrict ourselves to thinking about anime that run for one year or less so no Naruto Bleach Yugimanz etc and treat anime as belonging exclusively to the season in which they began airing so e g all of Shingeki no Kyojin counts as a spring anime I can substantiate this claim if need be both by reference to user ratings on sites like MAL and by reference to more subjective impressions by commentators who know a thing or two about anime That said I m sure those of you who have a finger on the pulse of the anime osphere probably have more or less the same impression >>> anime-production

I watched a few episodes of this show a little over years ago and i d like to know what it is so i can watch it again This has been bothering me for a long time now If i m not specific enough or get details wrong i apologize My memory about this show is very vague The main protagonist was a young boy age range anywhere from middle school to high school He had dark hair and i think he rode a motor scooter around the town I also believe he was poor It has a kind of Baccano feel to it so the setting for the time period is probably similar He finds a small box and eventually it turns into a giant robot Not a mecha per say because it couldn t be piloted So he and the robot become friends and he tries to hide the robot from his family often sneaking out to the junkyard where he hid it Eventually a couple other kids pop up that also have robots I think it mostly focuses on one girl There s also an organization maybe the government maybe some guy just lusting for power Either way he s trying to get his hands on all these robots so the kids have to fight him off and eventually the kids and their robots are wanted by the police Finally there s a guy probably an older man who lives in the junkyard and he knows all about the robots and assists the kids in whatever ways he can I know this explanation is very vague and i apologize Any help identifying this show is greatly appreciated Thanks for reading and if you have any help thank you for that too >>> identification-request

There are techniques that are the keys to Rokushiki Despite a claim in another answer from a well informed user that none of the CP members are haki users several of these techniques seem to be rudimentary forms of Busoshoku Haki It seems completely reasonable that the marines would be training them in the use of Haki based skills In particular Tekkai Rokuogan and Shigan seem to clearly be Haki based There are however some points against this including Luffy s reaction to Shigan Geppo and Rankyaku could feasibly be viewed as imparting ones willpower Haki to the air like a projectile Only Soru does not seem to fit this but Sanji s simular technique Blue Walk was at least partially transfered to Nami when his mind was transfered By this answer Haki is transferred but not physical strength There are several other techniques that if these are Haki based would also need to be Haki based such as Sanji s Sky and Blue walks and Zorro s ranged sword attacks Finally we address swordsmen Not covered by the CP s skill but still seems to be early stages of learning Haki is Zorro s cutting of steel His sword would normally not be able to cut something as hard or harder than itself but he learns to impart his willpower to it to make it cut what and only what he wants it to This is complemented by an early use of observation haki immediately prior to it in his fight against Mr My one question is therefore Are there any abilities that were shown prior to the introduction of haki on the show such as the potential examples above that have either been shown to work by using Busoshoku Haki knowingly or not after it s introduction or have been confirmed by canon sources to be Haki As I consider it Haki was introduced on Amazon Lily and in the several instances that were observed on the archipelago The nature of this question invites speculation as I ve done above but I would prefer justification in canon I understand anime physics don t have to be realistic but this would explain alot >>> one-piece

In episodes and at least towards the beginning of the latter episode of the second season we see Kaiki in a number of shirts in the same scene in the Okinawan cafe He first appears in a pink shirt which he wasn t initially wearing in the airplane Before changing to a blue shirt and a yellow shirt In the toilet we see him in what appears to be a different pink Hawaiian shirt and in the beginning of episode we see him in an orange shirt The changes in shirt seem to coincide with pauses in the conversation e g pauses indicated by the black screen or Kaiki s own thoughts accompanied by images such as departing airplanes But the conversation between Senjogahara and Kaiki probably takes place over a bit more than the course of one afternoon If that s the case should Kaiki s changes of shirt be taken as something stylistic without much meaning or is there some significance to it >>> monogatari-series

Producing an anime costs a lot mln yen mln In my opinion it is a very cruel job because animation studios have to design product and publish their jobs and they receive money only month after the first air when they sell the DVD containing the anime I m spending some time developing a open source d animation software I want to cover each step in the industry from the planning to the sound Assuming that the steps are Planning ok I can t do anything Storyboard Layout Key animation Inbetweening animation Colouring Effects What are the most expensive part of the job Or the one I can eliminate I m sure I can develop an assisted inbetweening program and maybe an auto colouring one keyframe is manually coloured you detect faces in the other keyframe and it will colour it the same way And also effects My question is what do you think I have to improve first to have an high quality software that really helps people in that job >>> anime-production

Some years ago I found this really great depressing anime and I cannot recall it s name It was built as a series of stories with each being independent from the rest Not like arcs but actual independent stories And one of those stories has ever since stayed with me as the the most depressing thing that I ve ever saw It was a true story of a young Japanese novelist who won the newcomer award in Japan or something along those lines It basically talked about his life s ups and downs and ended in his suicide In general the theme there was very dark and well suicidal but I loved it for that If I remember correctly it was set in the post WW era Japan One other thing I remember that the last story in the series was set in medieval Japan was quite colourful and seemed really out of place from the rest of the stories It was possibly even a fantasy story If I remember correctly it had only stories and was ep max possible less Although the last one was simply weird in that line up the previous two where quite heavy dramas exploring how a person can fall into suicide I vaguely remember something like this happening in one of them The main character young male early s or late teens went to this bar where he met another depressed women They hooked up and I think they became a couple They then proceeded to commit double suicide by throwing themselves of the cliffs When they got there they ate a lot of sleeping pills so they would drown in the sea and they jumped off the cliff The woman did just that but when the main character do not remember the name sorry was about to jump he first started to puke from all the booze they drank that night and puked out the sleeping pills At the time he did not think much of it and followed the women and jumped off the cliffs How ever because he failed to ingest the sleeping pills he did not drown and later was saved from the sea or washed up on the shore Anyway later he had some serious regrets on puking and not managing to kill himself Later on there was this scene where I think it was the same character but possibly it was the other story where the main male character was living with his wife Again only after going through some serious issues And was living in this big relatively speaking house and supporting the couple by creating manga based on his life full of profanities I think we nowadays would say it was seinen hentai if that makes any sense Anyway the character had gone through some series of hardships and though that he finally found if not a peaceful life than a livable life I remember one scene were his friend or was it an acquaintance came by to see how he was doing and when he saw how he was making money was quite shocked by it One day when he came home his publisher was there doing his wife When he confronted him the publisher told him that the manga that he was doing was not actually selling and this is why he got the cheques because his publisher got to have sex his wife Now his publisher proceeded to explain to the poor guy how he must have known all that and he should not be so shocked One of the more memorable scene is were the wife told the guy How could you have done this to me implyng that he basically pimped her to his publisher This of course lunged the main character into a suicidal fit where he tried to kill himself Hopefully it ring some bells to someone every time I hear that Clannad is a sad anime I think not really and think back on this one But I simply do not remember the name so I can t give them an example of a truly sad and depressing anime >>> identification-request

In Episode Light dies Soon after that Misa commits suicide But I m a little confused now because of this rule the death of the person whose name is written in the book can not lead to anyone else s death Now everyone knows that Misa will commit suicide if Light dies But the death of person whose name is written in the book can t lead to anyone else s death So basically ryuk shouldn t have been able to kill Light because if Light is dead that will indirectly lead to Misa s death So have I missed something in Death Note or am I right >>> death-note

In the manga Brotherhood we learn that the reason human transmutation is forbidden is because it would otherwise allow people to create their own private armies at least according to the man who talks to General Armstrong after she s transferred to Central Right after that we re shown the mannequin soldiers implying that they re the results of some form of human transmutation But it s pretty obvious that the mannequins are different from the products produced by Ed Al Izumi Curtis and Roy when they attempt or are forced to attempt human transmutation in the case of the mannequins the transmutation has actually produced what the alchemist probably wanted and is successful Given this what s the difference between the human transmutation referred to in the context of the mannequins and human transmutation as attempted by the sacrifices Is the difference in result simply an issue of having a different intended result and or maybe philosopher s stones or is there potentially a different explanation for this >>> fullmetal-alchemist

Okay first read this rule In the Death Note you cannot set the death date longer than the victims original life span Even if the victims death is set in the Death Note beyond his her original life span the victim will die before the set time So that means if you wrote something like John zeurt dies peacefully in the year that wouldn t work because this date is beyond his lifespan But that would mean if you wrote a date thats within his actual lifespan that would work But now there s this day rule The Death Note can only operate within days in the human calendar This is called the day rule So could the first example work >>> death-note

I am looking for an anime that I had watched fairly recently I watched it and it was on a school computer but I forgot which one Here s the details I remember It started off with an opening song There was a little girl who had wanted to be a cook for the king Her mother use to always love it when people loved and enjoyed her food Sadly she passed away and the girl was left alone I believe or well I think it did anyways She had this very fat relative or cousin to He was very enthusiastic and looked after her Not really sure I only got to watch two episodes of this series and I don t think it was the average minutes but perhaps maybe The first episode I remember is that this girl who wants to become the kings cook accidentally let a puppy loose into the palace which wrecked the noodles for the royal dinner There was this other girl All I can remember was she sounded spoilt rotten and was very unpleasant I believe at some point she tried to get this girl into trouble The next thing I remember is that the little girl said she could provide some noodles for wrecking the noodles in the first place since she grew some type of noodles It could have been tadpole noodles I m not quite sure on this either In the second episode there was the king He was riding on horseback with a whole lot of troops and looked like he was dressed in traditional looking armour like a samurai I believe they were looking to hunt down a giant boar Next thing I remember is that there are these people dressed like ninjas who try to kill the king Suddenly there is this big fight in a forest on horseback and some other elements such as the king chasing after the assassins after they fail killing him The final detail I remember is that girl that wants to be the kings cook and who ruined the noodles finds one soldier on the ground with her fat cousin and dog Suddenly three assassins walk up to her and tell her to move out of the way They were intent on killing the soldier She refused and one of the assassins who was a girl was told from one of the leader assassins to take care of her She closes her eyes as she is grabbed but then her cousin says something like leave her alone and throws a barrel of wine which the boar that the king was hunting looking for in the forest smells and quickly charges to where the smell was coming from and I think the girl cousin and puppy run away with the soldier I also remember that there was a cooking kind of competition on where you cook something really nice so you can become the kings cook She ended up cooking rice since that was the only ingredient left when she finally came She was late because she had to save that soldier so her cousin went and told her to get in the back of this pully and pulled her all the way to the palace and almost got refused entry for being late I also remember a scene where there is that spoilt girl who steals some other girls frog pet and pretends that the girl stole her ingredient for frog soup to try and eliminate her from being the frogs pet Just on a side note I think the girl who wants to be the kings cook is ming or mei I have no idea Oh and I just remembered something else the graphics weren t too dodgy but it did look a bit old too I am not a robot guys I can t remember everything peoples P Edit The girl is not tsundere It is more like an historic anime and there is no magic or anything unworldly in it Has a kind of ninja theme to it I wouldn t even know what year it came out anyways Recently Week ago or maybe days ago anyways The art style was a little old Not too familiar with many art styles anyways but it was still watchable I guess and didn t have to awful graphics The people in the anime do not typically look like the usual anime characters with unusual height or eyes or crazy styled hair and look pretty normal or well anime normal anyways It looks like it was set in a Japanese possibly ancient time similar to the medieval times There was a castle but it doesn t have a moat The girl has black hair and everyone wears pretty Japanese looking clothing such as possibly in the feudal time period Woman in the palace wore what looked like gowns and had their hairs in a bun I can t really remember much about it but that is as much as I can think off It isn t a new animes as far as I could tell since the graphics weren t too excellent Oh and while I am it I just remembered another detail The female assassin ninja had some type of symbol on her arm I think her sleeves got ripped by the boar and then she quickly covers it up Also the girl who wants to be the kings cook and saves that soldier had two rings that she got from her mother One was green and the other was Maybe red I have no idea but she ends up dropping it Does anyone know what anime this is >>> identification-request

THE DESCRIPTION HAS MANY BIG SPOILERS You have been warned I have read many posts and reviews where it said that the creators of Cowboy Bebop intended the movie to be between sessions and There are a few questions on this site which ask specifically where the movie is placed chronologically with the series and people have placed emphasis on the fact that chronological order is not very important to most of the series and that the main reason the movie is said to be before is because Ed and Ein are still with the Bebop in the movie whereas in the series they leave soon after Now it is a popular interpretation of the ending that Spike died and I don t want to start that debate yet but assuming he lives and is just sleeping at the end like Watanabe semi jokingly says in an interview only last year I believe that the movie could be set after the events of the series perhaps soon after or a few years Ed and Ein are back and Ed seems to return to places a few years after she leaves as the matron at the orphanage on earth says Is there any evidence to back up this view Also I request that anyone answering remember that my crucial assumption here is that Spike lives so please try not to start that debate as I m very aware many people believe he does not and often vehemently defend their view Think of this as a hypothetical if he lives could the movie be set a while after the end of the series >>> cowboy-bebop

As I have been watching anime I have found that a lot of the more modern shows which contain content not suitable for TV viewing use bright light to censor bodily parts overly violent bloody imagery etc When I watch older shows like Evangellion below there are also scenes that are inappropriate for viewing but the shows usually solve this by conveniently placed items or viewing angles In some other shows there are also placeholder images which are sometimes placed on top of the area to be censored a sort of combination between the two But at least these two alternatives are usually slightly humorous and do not feel overly forced whereas bright light from nowhere usually breaks my immersion with its very unnatural feel I find some shows have become unwatchable because of this trend I dropped Tokyo Ghoul recently to wait for the DVD release because I couldn t tell what was happening in certain scenes lack of light in this instance but same concept Where has this trend come from and which anime was first to include it >>> anime-history censorship

I ve noticed that a lot of Western fans seem to associate the genocide war in Ishbal with the Holocaust or alternatively the Middle East However from somewhat secondary sources I ve heard that Arakawa Interviewed war veterans Somehow was inspired by the plight of the burakumin or Ainu not sure about the second one This and the fact that this is a Japanese manga make me generally more inclined to assume that while there doesn t seem to be an real world parallel to Ishbal that it s more reasonable to assume that it was inspired by issues such as Japanese colonialism Sure Amestris is a predominantly white country but as noted this question Amestris seems to be based more on Europe in general with a possible emphasis on the UK And just because some aspect of the country is inspired by Europe doesn t mean some other of it can t be inspired by Asia But I m not sure if I m just reading too much into it with the latter bit Moreover my cynical self suggests that Western fans are also more likely to say Ishvalan War of Extermination Holocaust because they simply are more likely to have more experience with it or with the Middle East being an issue than with tensions in East Asia and not because this was necessarily explicitly stated somewhere What exactly is the arc involving Ishbal supposed to be based on if anything Is the oft cited factoid that it is based on the Holocaust true or is it more reasonable to associate it with issues within Japan or linked to Japan such as the colonialism of East Asia I ve argued that there is no real parallel but that the latter is a better interpretation in a comment somewhere but I m not sure if that s actually true While I have seen some translated snippets of Arakawa s comments from the manga which is where I got the two facts I cited I m not sure if there re better details elsewhere >>> fullmetal-alchemist

Lots of manga get an anime adaption and pretty often the anime s story deviates partly or a lot from the story told in the manga This usually leads to different endings lacking information or even giving surplus information as compared to the manga with the same name But this also made me wonder is there also an anime that shares the same name as a manga it supposedly was based on but deviates from this the story as told in the manga So the story in the anime is totally different from the manga but still shares the same name >>> anime-history manga-history

There s an anime series which I watched an episode of about years ago and I had always planned on continuing but I lost the name soon after I thought I would find it again eventually and I ve tried searching sometimes and today I searched for several hours but I can t seem to find it I d be very grateful for any help Here s what I know The setting was very RPG like but definitely not occurring in a game There were two groups who were shown throughout the episode Two people chatting in a inn restaurant tavern and a group of around people walking around the town which includes a swordsman who run into some people trying to rob them or someone else nearby They get into a fight with the villains in an alley someone hides behind a crate They win or the villains robbers run away Somehow the two groups become involved with each other that or the two people chatting were waiting for the other group the whole time Both groups do not come from that town and don t plan to stay there long either That s all I remember Other details I remember is that it has magic Everything looks very medieval middle ages like many RPGs that includes the buildings the armor the clothing etc The art didn t look new shiny years ago but it didn t look very old either I only watched the first episode so I m not sure who the main character was it seemed to be following a group more than just one but if there was one it was probably the swordsman The swordsman could fight but was a bit too quick to jump into fighting and had a bit of chivalry The two people he were with were not as enthusiastic but backed him up when he jumped into the fight in the alley Regarding the two other people talking in the restaurant one was a man who seemed intelligent one was a soft speaking woman who I believe had a cloth over her head They were discussing something important and she was someone important probably in hiding or trying to keep a low profile for traveling As for exactly how long ago I saw it I only know that its been at least years and at most years most like or >>> identification-request

In episode it was shown that Romdeau was in a state of disarray Many opted to leave the city instead of staying inside However what I noticed is that emigrants seem to be able to leave their home cities without gas masks or any protective gear The same applied to Vincent and emigrants from Mosk during one of his flashback at least from what I can remember They weren t inside a vehicle and they seem to have to walk to where they needed to go to Of course it s possible that they were vaccinated before going outside although it seems unlikely given the state of Romdeau during this time and that the city would try to keep them from going outside no matter what Yet Vincent was struck by disease after he went outside through the vent Although he did survived he either should have been immune from the conditions in the outside world he actually wasn t exposed during his travel from Mosk to Romdeau the vaccines keeping them healthy are temporary or something else So how did emigrants survive outside without succumbing to disease Have I missed anything >>> ergo-proxy

I ve been a fan of anime since Star Blazers in my childhood but I wonder about an overused cliche in anime action adventure series teenage prodigy heroes For example the most popular action based anime as opposed to comedy or relationship based currently on Netflix and Hulu as well as StackExchange tag frequency Attack on Titan Black Butler Bleach Death Note Fairy Tail Fullmetal Alchemist Knights of Sidonia Naruto One Piece Sword Art Online All of them feature unusually capable teens as the lead protagonists Adults are supporting characters or entirely absent Certainly there are exceptions Samurai Champloo etc and this trope is also seen in the US e g Adventure Time Avatar Young Justice etc but it s a matter of degree Non child heroes are not a rarity in western animation Avengers Batman Tranformers etc Is this a real thing in Japanese culture and if so what does it mean Or is it just a USA based artifact of marketing i e this particular subgenre is actively emphasized for translation or audience i e non child anime is just as common but has less active fans >>> tropes culture

I recently read the Kodomo no Jikan manga Then I read about the massive controversy when Seven Seas tried to release the series in the US explained in excruciating detail by Seven Seas s Jason DeAngelis here and summarized here I also read about Kaworu Watashiya s response showing that she absolutely did not one bit understand why the series was so controversial over here and that machine translation still has a long way to go since Watashiya got all her information from reading American forums passed through Google Translate I was particularly puzzled by her comments made with an authoritative tone that An adult even a parent who takes a bath with a child would be arrested in the United States This source also claims the series is only regarded as mildly risqu eacute in Japan Maybe I m just too American but Kojikan seemed like it would be at least somewhat controversial in almost any country Rin is only in third grade when the series starts and the later chapters deal with issues like sex ed masturbation menstruation and sexual assault in a fairly realistic way Was there any public controversy around the series in Japan Did it raise any eyebrows at all I d appreciate sources Obviously if the answer is no there is no such evidence so my threshold for no controversy is nothing visible in a major media outlet If the United Moral Guardians of Podunksville Hokkaido published a statement condemning Kojikan I do not expect anyone to find it Though good job if you do I m asking for evidence of a reasonably high profile controversy around the same scale as the one surrounding the US release >>> culture kodomo-no-jikan
I know that Koukin Shuuyu is a main character and I know he is not the protagonist But what I m wondering is does he play a big enough role in the series where he would show up in almost every episode or at least referred to One of my pet peeves is ecchi genre with a female protagonist I m a big disliker of shoujo anime Although I know this isn t one I ve been looking at this anime for a while but the ratings and reviews have been keeping me at bay The female protagonist doesn t make it any easier to swallow either >>> ikkitousen

While I went through the first episodes of the original Sailor Moon I noticed a few episodes that didn t really advance the plot much An example of this would be the episode where Jadeite poses as a radio announcer and sucks the energy out of women who receive fake declarations of love I have also found lists of filler episodes on the internet such as this one for the original Sailor Moon I ve also noticed that a lot of unnecessary plot seen in those episodes of the original anime is cut from Sailor Moon Crystal though to some extent this also just makes sense given that they have a limited number of episodes to work with How closely does the original anime follow the manga I understand that they are probably more or less similar in terms of plot but is there a significant portion of episodes or filler that s original material and not from the manga Edit I am referring to the original Japanese anime not the English or European dubs I already know that those involved quite a bit of censoring of things like nudity or same sex relationships I should also add that I just got into Sailor Moon and so am not too familiar with it >>> sailor-moon
In the first episode of the first season we see a Whispered Woman being taken away from a Russian facility before she is recaptured Mithril turns up and secure the area before Sousuke injects a sedative into her We know that Teletha Tessa Testarossa is a Whispered and works as the Captain of the Tuatha De Danaan while Chidori is relatively left to her own life I am wondering for the Whispered that Mithril rescues what do they do with them are they put to work like Tessa or are they relocated and kept safe in the same way Chidori is allowed to live a normal life but minitored >>> full-metal-panic
In the first Season Tessa tells Chidori about her bother who is a whispered in the Second Season Chidori comes across Tessa s bother Leonard When Sagura is talking to Gauron in the second season Gauron comments that Amalgam as a Whispered who counts in their highest ranks and we see shots of Leonard I am wondering just how much does Tessa knows about her bother does she know that he is working for Amalgam if not where did she believe he was all this time >>> full-metal-panic
During Season Chidori is being monitored afar by a man which we later learn is from the Intelligence division of Mithril who goes under the name Wraith After Sousuke is reassigned Chidori gets the drop on Wraith and confronts him but is later shot by Xia Yu Lan After Leonard turns up and kills Xia Yu Lan we find out Wraith isn t dead but the bullet to the head ripped apart a mask we see what looks to be a female eye after the conclusion of the Hong Kong Incident the Mithril Intelligence agent who was working with the SRT is talking to a woman who wasn t around before at the very end when Sousuke returns to school this same woman is watching Chidori and Sousuke from afar her comments leads us to believe she is Wratih However why did Wraith pose as a guy was there any benefit to her mission to make people believe she was the opposite gender >>> full-metal-panic
in the final episode of Full Metal Panic The Second Raid after Sagura destroys Gates Venom we see this this kinda looks human shape and not the cockpit of an Arm Slave which may have been blow out Since Gates is in Amalgam which is where Leonard is and Leonard has roughly Human size Arm Slaves with him was Gates a robot >>> full-metal-panic
In Full Metal Panic Fumoffu we see Hayashimizu Atsunobu the Student Council President when Sousuke addresses him he always calls him your excellency and stands at attention and he seems totally fine to condone Sousuke to interrogate the thug who passed on the message that Chidori had been kidnapped closing the blinds and not stopping Ren or Sousuke While in a school environment he is a figure of authority he is hardly the highest authority with the Teacher still above him and Sousuke never uses such a similar term for any teacher So why does Sousuke call Hayashimizu Atsunobu your excellency >>> full-metal-panic
In Puella Magi Madoka Magica before Ultimate Madoka s universe I read that the system where a Magical Girl would become a Witch was referred to as the Law of Wheels while after that the new system and Madoka herself is known as the Law of Cycles this term actually being used by Homura and the Incubators in the Rebellion movie I am wondering where did these terms come from Neither system seems like a wheel cycle as in neither one does a Magical Girl ever return to normal the origin EDIT I seem to have made a mistake as Mami may have said Law of Wheels in Episode in Ultimate Madoka s Universe but still it doesn t change my question of where these terms came from >>> madoka-magica

I ve been looking for this anime for some time now I hope I can describe it so someone will be able to identify it I watched it in around I was small child so I don t know for sure on videotape so it was released for some time then It was series about robot mecha pilots I don t think there was anything extraterrestrial or anything involving space but I could be wrong here The pilots were sliding into their robots and then they were rescuing the world I don t remember if the robots were able to combine but they were rather big I think the pilots fit in their heads I will update if I remember more Thanks EDIT I am absolutely sure it wasn t anything like Voltron Gundam or other notoriously known anime this is relative of course The thing that stuck in my head was the pilots sliding to the robots not sure if it was in main titles but definitely it was with music probably before every big action So there had to be some form of command center I m sure that things like pilot description would help but I am not absolutely sure pilots were young people but not kids about robot coloring red color can be in majority but after the years Thanks >>> identification-request

I m currently on episode of Revolutionary Girl Utena and I ve noticed that at certain points someone most likely Miki if I m not mistaken will pull out something that looks like a stopwatch or a counter This happens in the beginning of episode when the Student Council is discussing the next duelist and also happens earlier in some of the points concerning Nanami Some sort of clicking sound will accompany this But I m not really sure what this is supposed to signify if anything Is Miki counting something or is this supposed to just set the tone for something If so what is this something Update In episode Miki pulls out a stopwatch again after asking Touga if he s just treating his sister like a pet in the translation I was watching and states a time of seconds But I m still not sure what he s counting Afterwards the discussion immediately goes back to Nanami s loss to Utena >>> revolutionary-girl-utena

About or more years ago I had a VHS videotape cassette with an anime movie or an OVA recorded on it I don t really remember much but I remember that I watched it once or twice and liked it a lot I remember a beautiful girl in it a scene where the girl changed her clothes to swimming clothes in a changing room It was summer in the anime The girl was the main character and she appeared to be a normal schoolgirl but actually she wasn t that normal In the end she wore a sci fi costume She had dark long hair In the end there was a flat sci fi ish and grey colored aircraft and the girl played a big role there The cool sci fi airplane was giant as a small island and floating in the air for a long period of time but I don t remember why In the beginning it was all shoujo like but in the end it was more seinen It was not moe like Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica and it was not all that serious like JoJo s Bizarre Adventure Maybe it kinda resembles Kimi ga Nozomu Eien type of animation more realistic There wasn t anything absurd like giant breasts or explosions out of nowhere It was if I may say so realistic but it was not all that serious it had bright moments It is nostalgic remembering it and I want to rewatch it now when I am older This anime must be really old >>> identification-request
In Attack on Titan how did humans learn the titans weak spot How was it that they learned how to kill titans Was it through experiments with live captured titans The only example I could think off where humans actually successfully captured live titans and managed to get them within the walls was when they captured Sawney and Bean But during the time they had Sawney and Bean up until their untimely deaths humans were already actively aware of the titans weak spots which was the back of their necks which could be cut sliced attacked I am rewatching AoT now and am currently on episode I may have overlooked something the first time I watched hence I am rewatching it but I am quite positive this might not have been answered So how exactly did humans learn discover how to kill titans I still don t quite understand this Manga answers are perfectly acceptable >>> shingeki-no-kyojin

In Attack on Titans how exactly was everything paid for Not once in AoT so far did I ever see any exchanging of currency For example the Markets How do businesses make money then Is there a type of currency in AoT that they officially use For example do they just give away meat for free Are Potatoes Vegetables and cutlery such as plates bowls and cups free or have I just missed something Note I think food is free for the survey corps or the people that are training to enlist in the army and be able to leave outside of the walls but what about everyone else Is it free or is it paid for If it is then whats the currency Coins notes obviously probably not P or is there some sort of system where they trade for example their bit of farm land for a lot of cured meat or fish or vegetables for example So my question is how exactly are things purchased in AoT >>> shingeki-no-kyojin

The Tokyo ESP next episode previews are pretty simple They re just a mostly static screen on which the title of the next episode appears and Peggy the penguin says something which seems to be the usual cute sounding gibberish noises I noticed that Peggy seems to always say the same number of syllables as the title and with a similar rhythm to how it would be spoken in Japanese That makes me suspect that Peggy is actually saying the title of the next episode but changes the syllables based on some pattern Repeated syllables like in the episode preview shown above are pronounced the same as far as I can tell which seems to support this theory Looking at a few English language sources I couldn t find any discussions of this or even anyone suggesting that there might be some pattern Does Peggy s speech in the next episode previews follow some set pattern As a bonus does the pattern also apply to Peggy s speech in the episodes proper >>> japanese-language tokyo-esp

In episode Hollow Touch we learn that the prevailing myth among humans about how half spirits are born that if a pregnant woman is spirited away when she returns the baby later born is a half spirit is incorrect The real reason was that the Village of Oracles would take pregnant women and put them through a ceremony where the blood from a severed fox spirit s head is poured on the woman s stomach We know that the chief of the Village of Oracles has had numerous half spirits born before as when Zakuro was born he had plan to put her with the rest of the half spirits that was until he realized what power she had Even after Tsukuhane s escape the village chief and later Lord Omodaka continued in an attempt to create another half spirit with Zakuro s power Susukihotaru Bonbori and Hozuki are all half sprites Kushimatsu did say that she traveled with Zakuro finding half spirits and taking them in to protect them from the Village of Oracles But if the myth about a half spirit s birth was actually the work of the Village of Oracles then how were those born as half spirits Bonbori and Hozuki was raised in a cave and if the were born in the Village of Oracles Kushimatsu would not have been able to rescue them >>> otome-yokai-zakuro

from Urban dictionary Dandere A dandere is a character archtype that entails someone being quiet which is usually associated with shyness Dan comes from the word danmari which means silent and taciturn Dere means to become lovey dovey Not to be confused with Kuudere which is a cool person that becomes lovey dovey They are very similar in appearence and possibly behavior but their underlying character reasoning is different Being silent for the sake of being silent vs being cool I have a problem placing her as a dandere because she sometimes acts playful as the image above not antisocial Am I correct considering her dandere >>> oreimo

I started watching Bleach probably a month ago and quickly found it to be quite interesting But there are some things I just don t get For example Aizen I thought Aizen was awesome He commands such awe attention and fear and you can tell that from the Shinigami s protecting Karakura town But I don t get is reason for being As far as I remember every villain that Ichigo came across and defeated at least the fairly important ones had a background story To digress Grimmjow Barragan No and Neliora Espada s etc had a beginning Disappointingly Ulquiorra my favorite Espada btw had none Kaname had a reason for being Even Gin also another disappointment imo had a beginning despite its vagueness But back to Aizen from the very beginning he was just someone that had twice the amount of reiatsu when compared to a Captain level From what I got he simply wanted more power To destroy the soul king and in turn destroy Soul Society But what happens after that He obviously finds Hollows insignificant he hates the Shinigami but we don t know why I m not sure if many people feel the same way but there just wasn t enough back story as to why Aizen is In the end all we got was some speculation from Ichigo that doesn t really make sense btw about how Aizen felt lonely because no one matched his power So to find an equal Aizen groomed Ichigo s powers but the funny thing is Aizen according to Ichigo s speculation in the meantime sought more power by subjugating the Hogyouku to his will If he had so much power and he felt lonely simply because he outclassed all others why not find a way to suppress if not completely get rid of his powers akin to Zaraki s eyepatch Ichigo speculates that maybe Aizen let go of his sword willingly but in Room he doesn t look like someone that gave up his sword willingly The explanation that we get from Ichigo sounds rather similar to what the author gave us about Jin Kariya But there was a reason for Jin s motive and considering his back story the explanation for his defeat does make sense But Aizen I just don t get it If anyone can make sense of my question can you give me a satisfactory answer P >>> bleach
In Rebuild of Evangelion the first movie is almost an exact retelling of the original anime series But soon it begins to deviate more and more and more sad until I really wasn t sure of what I was watching anymore but I digress So lets consider both storylines as happening on parallel universes What is the event onscreen or not in the Rebirth series that is the turning point of the forking deviating storylines While this may seem opinion based it is not I am asking you to compare the rebirth movies to the original series script or storyline wise and backtrack the visible differences to their sources pointing to a specific event that happened onscreen or was mentioned that may be the cause of those differences looking backwards for the cause of that other event Pepper your answer with references please You may add a few speculations in making your chain of causality if the events have a significant impact or relation >>> neon-genesis-evangelion

As a viewer of both series from start to end I can see several elements in Captain Earth that seems to borrow from Gurren Lagann especially in the second half of both of the series In episode just before the entangle link Daichi was interfered by Planetary Gears and put inside a dream where he was tempted to keep on living his normal life not involving with the whole saving the world business However he broke out of the illusion due to the memories of his friends in his heart This is similar to how the almost entire crew of Dai Gurren dan got trapped in Extradimensional Labyrinth in episode of Gurren Lagann and experienced their dreams being fulfilled but managed to escape from it with the help of Kamina Daichi and co did an entangle link to jump from Earth to Uranus similar to how Dai Gurren dan jumped through dimension from Earth to Anti Spiral s home world They both missed on their first try and got ambushed In the final battle Daichi charged into the transformed Blume while sacrificing the expansion layer which is assembled as the smaller mecha is launched to Tenkaidou This is similar to the final battle between Simon and the Anti Spiral where outer layers of the Gurren Lagann is left behind as Simon charged in with his Lagann and destroy the Anti Spiral Kill T Gangs the perceived antagonists of the series don t have any libido Orgone energy therefore they can t reproduce while all human has Orgone energy This is similar to the Anti Spirals in Gurren Lagann who don t have any Spiral energy since they purge it themselves while human has Spiral energy Both series feature clashes between one with the source of all powerful energy and one without such energy Are these similarities normal for mecha anime especially when the first points are all focused on the last fight Has there been any interview regarding this topic >>> gurren-lagann captain-earth

In Trinity Universe a number of characters from games developed by Gust and Nippoin Ichi Software NIS are featured in it some are obvious but i am wondering which characters belong to which developers and which may be original characters Bellow is a List of characters Demon God Dog King Kanata Fox Spirit Tsubaki Suzaku Dark Hero Lucius Valkarie Rizelea Mizuki Violet Pamala Macaroon Miyu Recit Pirate Queen Etna Prinny and in cutscenes the Prinny Squad Flonne Fallen Angel NOTE i have tagged atelier and disgaea because i am assuming the characters would originate from these series >>> atelier disgaea
In a side quest of the first Hyperdimension Neptunia game you fight a boss called Macaroon Here s an image of her unsure if this is from the original or Re Birth In Trinity Universe she appears as an Inn Keeper before Pamula takes over and as a shop keeper before Violet takes over I ve played though the Disgaea Games with the exception to Disgaea D a Brighter Darkness but it was released after Trinity Universe and Hyperdimension Neptunia and I haven t seen her so I assumed that she is a Gust character probably from the Atelier series since both games feature Gust characters Hyperdimension Neptunia has a character who represents Gust called Gust like how NISA has Nisa I thought she d appear in the Atelier Iris series but I m currently on the third one and I have yet to meet her but I know some of the Atelier Games were never localized and I m assuming she s from the Atelier series Gust also did Ar Tonelico and Ar no Surge So I am wondering where does she appear Or was she an original character only used in cross over works >>> atelier hyperdimension-neptunia
In the description for Ar no Surge Ode to an Unborn Star it talks about how song and music are used as magic and it s character development AR Nosurge Ode To An Unborn Star PS is a Fantasy Sci fi Dimension RPG that takes place in a world where music and song can create magic Ar Nosurge Ode to an Unborn Star has a unique character development system that focuses more on the bonds relationships between the main characters than their success in missions and battles as the player s party grows stronger if the characters have a closer relationship Soruce Ozgameshop now this sounds much like the Ar Tonelico series which talks about how music is used as magic and how to develop characters strength you need to develop their relationships with one another also both games were developed by Gust This makes me think that the games are related story wise so i am wondering if they are and if so when does Ar no Surge Ode to an Unborn Star occur in relation to Ar Tonelico >>> ar-tonolico ar-no-surge

In the Rebellion film we see Homura turn into what she realises is a witch after she discovers some oddities about the version of Mitakihara city she s supposedly living in because of her despair This reason for her turning into a witch makes sense to me because it would be valid under the laws of the universe prior to Madoka s changing of them However I m a bit confused about how Homura managed to become a witch after the law of cycles came into effect if under this regime magical girls disappear instead of becoming witches once their energy is used up Why exactly then was there this exception to the law of cycles I might have missed something since I haven t really followed Puella Magi Madoka Magica very closely I suppose the fact that Homura is the only person around who knows of what the former regime was might be important in this but I think I probably missed something when I watched the film >>> madoka-magica

Knuckle Bine is listed as being a natural emitter but I am having difficultly reconciling that with his main power As an emitter the most difficult class for him to master is the conjuration and then ignoring specialisation transmutation His ability is to donate sure you could call it emit his Nen into another fighter That Nen will gain interest until it reaches a point where it can force the other fighter into zetsu for days The difficult thing to reconcil is that this Nen takes the shape of an indestructable mascot and has very unusual properties following very exact rules The creation of a physical manifestation is conjuration This creature appears to be made of Nen which means it wouldn t actually be a physical object transmutation These kinds of contracts rule following abilities seem to be tied to conjuration as well I could even buy that he is using manipulation to control the other person s Nen to force Zetsu Why is he labelled as an emitter Is his main ability emission or is he using a different type than his natural Do other emitters have such unusual Nen properties maybe the other ones I m familiar with are just odd >>> hunter-x-hunter

Sailor Pluto was commissioned by Queen Serenity Sailor Moon s mom to guard the Space Time Door which she is shown doing in the R season but she is later allowed to leave and thus shows up with a civilian form Setsuna in the S season One of the rules given by Queen Serenity was that she could not leave her post at the door She does go on to break all of the rules but according to Wikipedia Neo Queen Serenity future Sailor Moon gives her permission to leave her post But why Does the door not need to be guarded anymore Is it temporary leave and she will need to return eventually or is it permanent leave In the manga Sailor Pluto s guarding location is located outside of time so perhaps she could technically be there as well as have a th century civilian incarnation that is at a point inside time so she could apparently continue to guard the door while she shows up in S the SuperS movie and Sailor Stars but this is unrelated to why in the anime Neo Queen Serenity would excuse her from her post >>> sailor-moon

By my understanding the chimera ant sexs are as follows A Queen can eat any animal plants seem to be excluded and produce children without mating A King can mate in order to produce a Queen All others are generally non reproductive If the Queen or King another ant is loyal to dies however they can go off to mate as the King does to produce a Queen A generally non reproductive ant can have a traditionally male or female identy and appearance but this can likely be due to the food source The original Queen does not have human female characteristics as opposed to human male besides those one would consider maternal Is there anything to indicate that the female appearing chimera ants any different from this pattern The wiki does not know The only female besides the queen to reproduce was Zazan who used a non tradition means of reproduction which seems at least partially to be her Nen ability as opposed to something the other female ants could do I remember one other ant saying she was going to run off and become a queen but I don t think any details were given The male appearing ones greatly out number the females but this seems consistent with the show as a whole >>> hunter-x-hunter

OK this is a long shot as I only remember two scenes It s just stuck with me and I would be very interested in finding out what anime it was I saw it about maybe years ago and I don t know if it was new then or not probably not anime was never a big thing in the UK back then I think I saw it on the Bravo channel but I m guessing as it was the only channel willing to show anime that had anything remotely interesting other channels had heavily edited Kiddy stuff The first scene I remember was a stand off from two wizards or magic users One was an old man on the ground I think he had white hair He was facing an evil wizard who was levitating some distance away yet they could hear other as they always seem to do in anime The old wizard shot some kind of magic arrow that he seemed very certain would kill this evil wizard but the evil wizard blocked it with the palm of his hand which was in a white glove with an up side down pentagram The old wizard clutched then clutched his heart bleeding as if struck by the arrow which was still in the evil wizard s hand who seemed unaffected by this shocked at what had happened and then fell down presumably dead The old wizard laughed The other scene was of some woman supposedly important but I can t remember why I think the evil wizard wanted her for something She was writhing in pain on the floor It s daylight and they d in a meadow or plains short grass and where she rolled there was just dirt She stops writhing but continues shaking and starts wretching heaving Suddenly something pokes out from her mouth and starts coming out of her it ends up being a giant white pink maggot which promptly wriggles away She survives the ordeal and lays there shaking recovering There s a voice over of two men who I think were with her but not showing at the time One is younger asking what happened and one is older possibly the old wizard I mentioned earlier explained she gave birth to a maggot and this was due to dark magic Oddly neither seem surprised by the fact there is a maggot almost the size of an adult human or concerned that the maggot might become a giant fly which are annoying pests when tiny and swattable a giant fly is just Ick From the haziness of my memory I am not sure what kind of setting it is The clothing is all simple but also something you d expect in older Japan robes and basic plain cloth type I don t recall the buildings but I think it is pre machine times so I don t think there s cars or guns The animation style has that older grittier texture to it which all the older anime seem to have something between Violence Jack and CyberCity Oeda I think it was a movie OVA rather than a series but I may be mistaken I get the impression it was a not for kids kind of anime even though I was a kid at the time but I m guessing on that because back then those were the only ones I watched except for Vampire Princess Miyu and because it was an after pm watershed thing I don t really have much more detail than this I am sorry but it stayed with me and can t seem to find it when I do my searches If you could help at all it would be appreciated If you solve this you will have my undying gratitude and I d even give you my last rolo if I actually ate those >>> identification-request

When I watch the anime and hear the name of the characters Soo won Son Hak I thought that the manga is written by a Korean and published in Japan like the case of Freezing I can t be more wrong to assume that When I check Akatsuki no Yona on mangaupdates it was written by Kusanagi Mizuho whose profile suggests that he is a native Japanese Foreign names are common very common in Japanese manga It s very common introduce a foreigner main character or not to join the rest of the Japanese cast Apart from those cases we have story where the setting is in a land foreign to Japan or in an alternate universe where the names of the character are made foreign like in the case of Akatsuki no Yona However in most of the manga I have read that falls into this category the names are dominantly Western and I have never seen any with all the characters having Korean names Why does the author go to the trouble to use Korean names for the characters Why not Japanese >>> akatsuki-no-yona

I m reading the Fate Stay Night visual novel Early on in the Kotomine Church you can reach a bad ending by choosing to have Shirou give up his Command Spells and withdraw from the Holy Grail War as a Master He goes outside to sever his contract with Saber who says that normally she would kill a Master who abandoned her Shirou asks if she ll form a contract with another Master and Saber says that Archer s Master Rin Tousaka should be able to bring out her full power Upon parting with Shirou she goes into the church presumably to form a contract with Rin Also in the Studio Deen Fate Stay Night anime I haven t reached this far yet in the visual novel but I assume it s similar Kirei Kotomine commands both Zero Archer Gilgamesh and Stay Night Lancer Cu Chulainn I assume he was officially the Master of at least Lancer since unlike Gilgamesh Lancer would have required a contract to stay in the world But I can t remember if it was ever stated that he is the official Master of both or if Gilgamesh was maintaining his existence with his own mana and just stuck with Kirei for his own reasons We do know that it s possible for a Servant to have two Masters as for a time both Kayneth and Sola Ui are Masters to Lancer in Fate Zero But are the scenarios above instances of Masters with two Servants Would Rin have been able to make a contract with Saber while also maintaining a contract with Archer or was Saber relying on her knowledge that Rin wanted her as a Servant and would cut off Archer if Saber became available Was Kirei the Master of both Archer and Lancer or only of Lancer with Archer a free agent If the answer is yes do we know how the situation with Command Spells works I assume this isn t a problem for Kirei as he gained all the leftover Command Spells from previous wars when he found his father dying from Kayneth s bullet in Fate Zero But would Rin have gotten an extra three Command Spells if she made a contract with Saber or would she have to save the one she had left as a sign of her control over both Saber and Archer I m still early into the visual novel and I haven t yet seen the last four episodes of Fate Zero so please use spoiler tags as needed >>> fate-stay-night fate-zero

For example the end of season fights in Dragon Ball Z the fights between the Eva and the Angels in Neon Genesis Evangelion I ve noticed it in far more things but these are the most recent in my memory When a fight is occurring the more damage which is done to something even if it is mechanical the more powerful it sometimes becomes That doesn t make any sense to me I would prefer an explanation which relates to Japanese culture if such a thing exists for example the reason why anime has a lot of characters machines with weapons attached to their arms is because the Japanese are of the view that weapons are an extension of the body not something to be picked up and thrown away like a pistol in an American action movie that kind of thing However any insight at all would be great >>> tropes

In the second episode at about the minute mark October st Airi Hasekura lends Yui Furukawa a spare uniform she had in school Airi s bow tie is orange and I think the bow ties colours have something to do with either the students year or their class If that were so it d be reasonable to assume that the spare Airi had would have a orange bow tie However the first image we see of Yui shows her with a green bow tie That would have been fine if for the next minute or so the bow tie didn t change its colour from green to orange and back four times So the bow tie is green when first seen at orange at green at orange at and green again at On the next day October nd Yui s bow tie is consistently green I m assuming the bow tie was supposed to be orange on the first day and green on the second presumably because she would ve gotten a green bow tie meanwhile This assumption also comes to the conclusion that this was an animation mistake However since there was a time quake at the end of the first episode it came to my mind that this could have something to do with the plot But since that minute was the only one where this change was seen I was more inclined to believe this was a mistake So basically my question is Were the switching colours of the bow tie accidental or were they intentional thus being plot related >>> waremete

In the second episode of Code Geass Akito the Exiled a man calling himself Julius Kingsley exites a train of the royal family To understand this episode and not getting spoiled by my question you should have seen Code Geass R completely the beginning of Code Geass R and the first episode of Code Geass Akito the exiled Note that Code Geass Akito the Exiled takes place in the year beetween Code Geass R and Code Geass R The man exiting the train looks like Lelouch his behaviour is also similar to Lelouch s except Lelouch is less arrogant The facts that Suzaku accompanies him and he wears an eyepatch on his left eye the source of Lelouch s Geass made me think whether this really is Lelouch or not My first thought was that Lelouch lost his memories of the time before he was send to Japan maybe he lost more memories too and sees himself as a member of the royal family Also Julius Kingsley takes complete control of the troup planing As Lelouch is a great tactician I came to the conclusion that Julius Kingsley has to be Lelouch Am I right If so why does he call himself Julius Kingsley And what happened in the train when he desperately begged for water Thanks in advance >>> code-geass

In the Naruto manga Kakashi Hatake has been acknowledged by both Jiraiya and Tsunade to be one of Konoha s most powerful shinobi But Kakashi himself had confessed that Orochimaru was on a completely different level than him who in turn openly acknowleged that Itachi Uchiha was more powerful than him Obito Uchiha was noted to be more powerful than any other uchiha except Madara Uchiha whom Kakashi defeated My question is at the time when Kakashi defeated Obito had he surpassed all of Tsunade Jiraya Orochimaru and Itachi Is there any reference in the manga itself from which a definite answer can be given either in the affirmative or in the negative >>> naruto

Definitely Pre Female looking character being the major focus in at least one episode She has a third eye on her forehead that is invisible unless it opens which empowers her somehow like Pai in x Eyes or Honoka from The Third Most likely An OVA or movie that I watched in the mid to late s and most anime I watched at the time were fairly recent She is the protagonist who has to fight and eliminate those dangerous targets who are either humans or monsters and are strong as hell By strong I mean strong in individual fights not can nuke the whole city instantly type strong She is a young adult woman thus she looks slightly taller than both Pai and Honoka Her age and height probably coincides with Motoko Kusanagi s or are not far off from hers She has natural hair color probably black or brown I can t recall clearly her hair length and style but it s again probably like Motoko Kusanagi s her hair falls between the neck and the chest and I think her hair is not really styled and definitely not fancy just natural or combed straight She is a good fighter and I think she fights with handguns knives strings or some more modern weapons like grenades but nothing that has great firepower She either acts alone or has a comrade but she is the only one I remember because she is too badass and just steals the show especially when she uses her third eye power When she is about to use her third eye power the eye doesn t open immediately a horizontal line on her forehead appears briefly first The third eye may have emitted red green or blue light or I might have mixed this up with the background color because I remember towards the middle or end of the episode the city night colors become tainted with red or green due to the powers of an enemy When she uses her third eye power she changes to a slightly colder or different personality but I think she s already cool when in her normal state The background is dark most of the time probably because most events take place at night in a city The time is set in the present and I think in some scenes wired fences appear near a factory or the seashore maybe The art style looked very realistic to me as a child It may help to compare it to the art style of Ghost in the Shell Dragon Century or Battle Angel Alita basically what one would expect from a well drawn late s to late s anime I think I have only watched around minutes in one sitting so the descriptions are for two episodes max I don t know if there is something before or after the parts that I ve watched It is NOT The Third The Girl with the Blue Eye I have seen that one and remembered it clearly I have looked through a list on tvtropes but nothing except x Eyes rang a bell It might have been x Eyes or something I conjured up in a vivid dream in which case I think I did a good job and would really like it to be animated My final hopes lie in this regularly updated list of three eyes and you the community I do welcome answers pointing to which episode or two from x Eyes best matches my descriptions but definitely I repeat it is NOT The Third The Girl with the Blue Eye >>> identification-request

I m wondering if there s an imbalance in Japanese society as there is in American society Or if anyone has come across a survey that found the percent of female vs male protagonists in anime and manga I think the main difference in anime and manga is that the Japanese have created genres to meet the interests of those who consume anime and manga which if I m not mistaken is a far larger amount than Americans who consume comics and cartoons For boys they have shounen and for girls shoujo For more matured tastes we have seinen and josei which could arguably still be divided into men and women In shounen the protagonist is predominantly male and in shoujo the protagonist is usually female Should I instead be looking at which genre is produced more for my answer >>> anime-history resources

It s a little bit foggy what I remembered is that the main protagonist is a woman wearing black clothes aiming to destroy an evil professor research The professor did research on human transformation to animal something like that The professor probably kidnapped children for human testing put them in cylindrical tube filled with fluid for experiment My clearest memory of that anime is that the main protagonist met her old friend who had been transformed into a black lion tiger by the professor which she knew by a scar on the tiger eye The tiger lion also knew her when it saw her old friend s picture accidentally when they fought I think that her friend was still human but when he was brought to fight her he transformed I guess due to drug injected to his body by the professor However after that he couldn t change back to human form When they remembered each other her friend was still in lion tiger form Moreover there was one time where this woman seemed to get more powerful like she got the green power from the research subjects of the evil professor like she knew them as well when she fought the evil prof in his lab Thank you >>> identification-request
In the Hunter X Hunter anime Meruem is said to be arguably the strongest character in the series However while reading about Hisoka I found that he once thought to challenge Ging to a battle to death which seems astonishing becuase Netero once said that Ging is one of the five best nen users in the world My question precisely is that is there any reference either in the manga or in the anime that conclusively says that Meruem is far more powerful than Hisoka Note In the anime Neferpitou s aura is reported to have much more murdorous that both Hisoka and Illumi s but I don t know how it necessarily implies that Hisoka is weaker than Meruem >>> hunter-x-hunter

My best guess is that the anime aired on Cartoon Network sometime between and for at least one and probably no more than two seasons I don t remember many details other than that it was a kind of action adventure anime with several warrior characters trying to save the world from some evil What was memorable about it was that they failed at the end of the first season and the world was destroyed But the second season made clear the heroes through some magic had escaped into a parallel universe at an earlier point in the timeline wherein they succeeded It was unusual because most shows don t go into such depth about how time travel would probably work by sending you to a parallel world instead of your own timeline >>> identification-request

Not many anime have a dedicated episode for going to the cinema concert amusement park circus football match camping or any other activities But almost all of them spare at least one of their episode for a trip to the beach episode The characters sometimes travel a long distance and or struggle among hardships for this trip Is is just for fan service showing boobs and bikinis Is it related to a strong cultural interest Or is this because of a psychological project of the Japanese government for encouraging Japanese youth for swimming This reminds me of USA TV series In almost all shows it is a must that at least one episode must be dedicated to a gay character one episode for a Jewish character and all good working computers are Apple except for the ones which get hacked or broken So what does make beach so special in anime >>> tropes

Regarding the question that was asked before Do Emiya Shirou and Arturia ever meet again after Fate stay night In the Visual Novel of Fate Stay Night Realta Nua once you have seen all endings a new ending appears accessible from the title screen call Last Episode this is in parts a Monologue of the Fate Route and a second part where Arturia is hearing from Merlin about a miracle achievable by people one who wait endlessly and one who pursue endlessly eventfully the pursuer will stop when they reach the waiter What Merlin is referring to is Arturia waiting and Shirou pursueing eventually Shirou reaches Avalon where Arturia is sleeping and the finally reunite it s not entirely sure how long it took Shirou to reach Avalon however considering that Avalon transcends all magic including the Magics it must have taken an eternity for Shirou to reach Obviously if it took them an eternity to meet it s common sense that it never happened So my theory is that there are two options for this occasion The author s definition of eternity is something different from what is known to the public That it was some sort of an inside joke to troll the audience who desperately want to see them reunite Is there any official statement about how long eternity is according to the Fate Stay Night series Are there even any clues on which to base some sort of speculation on the matter Or maybe the light novel perhaps mentions something about it I really want to know how much Saber had to suffer in order to finally meet with Shirou IMO after all she s been through she has suffered quite enough already >>> fate-stay-night

It s been bugging me for a few days now I can t really remember a lot about it but here are the things I kind of remember I think it was Korean manhwa The setting was old martial arts was common I think the MC had amnesia He liked to climb trees shown chapter I think He time traveled back to a younger body mind traveled His parents were suspicious of him for being different than usual His parents were killed by thugs The female helper who was taking care of the main character got kidnapped and raped He later tracked the guy who attacked them and was about to kill him when suddenly a girl stopped him from doing so It turned out to be the helper she was pregnant and in love with her captor He left through the window The main character was scared of the main enemy I think lt The enemy was wearing Sephiroth like trench coat tall Near the end he found out that the enemy was him from the future or alternate outcome of his choices They fought in the courtyard and both died I think or just his future self I m not sure if this is only manga that I m describing It kinda feels I have tried googling this with what I think the genre tags it would be under but failed to find it I hope someone can help me stop this nagging in my head lt Thank you for your time >>> identification-request

I am sure many of you have come across this trope or art style in some anime although off the top of my head I can only remember its appearance in Full Metal Panic Fumoffu as shown above I think this trope is used mostly in comedies Someone has been asking the same question here Spirals Just spirals Apparently there are spirals of depression and spirals of happiness I think I heard the depression spirals are meant to represent sad spirits ghosts or something like that But if the character has spirals on her cheeks she s happy If there s a spiral on her finger when she points at you she s being triumphant or prideful Can anyone clear this up Is there any source to that statement My questions are Is there a name to this trope or art style What is the intended effect of a spiral on a character s index finger Where did this trope or art style come from >>> tropes

Note I m referring to the series It s been a while since I saw it in full and unlike the manga continuity I haven t seriously kept up with it In the series Wrath is the homunculus created from Izumi Curtis child who either was stillborn or died shortly after birth After Ed finds and interacts with him he realises that Wrath has his leg and arm and if I m not mistaken Wrath talks about wanting the rest of Ed s limbs Wrath acquires the arm and leg when the brothers attempt human transmutation Later after Ed s disappearance into the alternate universe we also see Wrath fitted with automail that was intended for Ed According the wiki this happens after Dante forces the removal of the limbs Why did Wrath need or want the limbs in the first place If I m not mistaken There wasn t any note of the child Wrath was created from having deformities which suggests that Wrath had his original limbs that didn t come from Ed This suggests that Wrath might have wanted Ed s limbs for some other purpose e g wanting them in themselves wanting to be able to perform alchemy but I don t remember if this was explicitly stated anywhere Could someone shed any light on this and perhaps provide an episode I could refer to and rewatch >>> fullmetal-alchemist

A common conclusion by English speaking followers of SnK is that Hange Zoe is nonbinary since there is no specific reference to Hange s gender in the language used in the manga See here for an example On the flip side the in text justification that gendered pronouns aren t used isn t useful in the original Japanese context and there are a bunch of other key characters to whom this lack of gender specific reference applies to I m also a cynic and I have seen enough cases of cultural myopia among English speaking animanga fans that I m simply a bit suspicious In any case there seems to be a great deal of drama floating around about this for instance some of the posts here There s also been the suggestion that the creators don t care what gender Hange is assigned to but since this indifference apparently at least according to the OP extends to all characters even those who seem relatively well defined as male or female I m sceptical of the value of this fact Is there anything clear consensus or restriction that at least rules out some possibilities with regards to Hange Zoe s gender from a culturally aware interpretation of the material from SnK I m asking this in part since it probably would be useful to have a resource and while I have my own vague conclusions based on webpages and blog posts like the above I believe it d be useful to get other perspectives particularly as someone who has not followed the manga >>> shingeki-no-kyojin

in Fate Zero Episode Rin s Adventure shows how she was forced to move out of Fuyuki with her mother by her father in preparation for the th Holy Grail War but runs away from home when her friend Kotone disappears like other children from her school and Rin attends the funeral of one of the children who were found mutilated in Fuyuki According to the Wikia for Kotone it says It is implied that Kotone meets the same gruesome fate as most of Ryuunosuke and Caster s other victims during the novel She is never referenced again afterward The anime version of the events play out differently as Rin manages to follow Ryuunosuke to a old building where he is keeping a number of children She finds Kotone among them and she manages to save them all by shattering the magecraft that was holding them in a trance Kotone returns to school afterward with the other victims Now watching the episode i can see how saving Kotone spurs Rin to study more to become the Magus she becomes in Fate Stay Night however i am wondering what is considered Kotone s fate in the canon loosely used considering and if she dies in the canon how does this affect Rin s motivation for study >>> fate-zero

In Fate Zero it seems Caster is able to find Saber far too easily i can understand how he found her during her s and Lancer s fight as Lancer as sent an invitation to all servants and Masters and Rider even notes that the other servants were sulking around watching the fight Before the attack on the Einzbern Castle she intercepted Saber and Irisviel while they were driving he was waiting ahead of them on the road and he was able to quickly locate the Einzbern castle despite the fact that the Einzbern s wouldn t make their base of operations so easy to find as i remember Ilya or Rin noting that the Forest around the castle messes with people s senses which make it hard to escape from while being hunted down by Beserker Now i can understand how Medea was able to track everyone in Fate Stay Night as she set up her workshop on the Leyline nexus at Ryuudou Temple and was manipulating all of Fuyuki s Leylines from that point not to mention her abilities make her seem like a god to modern Magi so Einzbern would be child s play and i assume Rin s knowledge of the castle comes from the fact by Fate Stay Night she is the Second Owner of Fuyuki as such she would be aware of the Einzbern s and Matou s locations along with every other Magus Workshop legally operating in Fuyuki However Caster has neither of these things and both him and his Master don t operate like proper participants in the Holy Grail War so how does he keep finding Saber >>> fate-zero

In episode five or six of Sidonia no Kishi Tanikaze and Shizuka were rescued by their fellow knights against orders of the captain The rescuers adopted a Gardes formation traveling to and from the protagonist s location Is the scientific reason behind this peculiar formation explained anywhere in the series because I can t recall Their formation was a perfect circle when they traveled to Tanikaze s location but was uneven as they carried his frame hence balance might be out of the answer This formation was also used later in the series when they were going to attack the massive Gauna as the picture shows They used all for the formation but still the mission grouping were in frames per objective I don t think this question is a duplicate of this question because I m asking for the scientific explanation of the formation I m also aware this question may be put on hold or closed as too speculative but it s an interesting thing to ask if the explanation is in the series anyway I believe krazer s explanation to the question above as ton yeung comments below is on spot after a little research However what I really want to know is the benefits in having everyone in one giant ring when they could create two frame rings that would ve been apt on the later event I mentioned They could even have frame rings that might cover a greater area in the long run or not Does it save energy minimize danger or perhaps guarantee a lesser chance of being lost in space >>> knights-of-sidonia
Remembering that there was a dubbed version of one of the OP s from the FMA in Cantonese that seems to have been popular in Hong Kong judging from YouTube I wanted to know if there was anything similar for NGE s A Cruel Angel s Thesis I found this song on YouTube there was at least one other upload of a song with the same voice and I also found a set of lyrics that approximately correspond to what is sung there However I haven t really been able to locate the singer s identity from a quick Google search Moreover there doesn t seem to be mention of a singer or a dub of the song on the Chinese Wikipedia although perhaps my Chinese skills aren t just good enough for me to pick this up I also managed to find a different recording with a female voice that was in Cantonese but had different lyrics which makes me somewhat suspicious as to the existence of an official dub It s of course possible though that a song will have multiple covers in the same language by prominent artists as happened with a popular Angela Aki song I also looked up the Cantonese dub of the first episode of NGE and the one I found kept the OP in the original Japanese Is there an actual reasonably prominent dub of A Cruel Angel s Thesis in languages other than Japanese I m particularly interested in whether or not there are any Chinese dubs I m looking for something comparable to Eason Chan s dub of the FMA OP in the sense that it should be reasonably prominent and done professionally and not say a amateur fan made production >>> theme-song neon-genesis-evangelion
I only watched the first episode of Knights of Sidonia and the main reason I dropped it was that the CG ran at an unbearably low framerate I just took another look at it and it looks like most of it past the opening sequence was on threes I can understand why it s rare for anime to do hand drawn animation besides pans etc on ones it takes a lot of work But I can t comprehend why this would happen with Sidonia it was CG It seems like cranking the framerate up to twos or ones would just be a matter of changing a setting in whatever tool they were using to render the CG Last year s Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio was full CG too and it didn t have this problem Do we know why the CG framerate was so low Was it production issues or an artistic choice or Side question did it get better in later episodes and or on the BD >>> knights-of-sidonia

I read it probably one or two years ago but I m pretty sure it was older than that Its art style was extremely detailed maybe even too much so It was quite violent as well e g at some point a character throws a sink or something like that through the body of another one The story was about a group of students maybe high school not too sure about that who build a Frankenstein ish monster which should serve them in doing something I can t really remember The monster at the end rebels against the group and slaughters them all They kidnap and maybe rape one of their teachers The leader of the group had some kind of black star and at some point he meets a fortune teller who tells him that the black star is a mark of great evil and that people like Hitler had one but also that the boy would be even more successful than them I am pretty sure it had an anime adaptation but it was less gory and wasn t well accepted EDIT I m absolutely not sure about this but the title may have been the name of the creature >>> identification-request

I m watching Dragon Ball Z Kai and never really thought about it If Bulma was able to pack up her cave back into capsules why couldn t she put the Dragon ball s in the house then pack up the house The resulting capsule would be small enough to cause confusion for anyone who had the dragon radar as it would be in the vicinity if it still showed up but could be hidden in someone s pocket or even swallowed regurgitated as necessary It could have even served as a this radar is on the fritz we don t have any of the balls to hand over they re still out there somewhere excuse if cornered Was this simply a case of the characters not thinking to try it or is there something that would prevent the dragon balls from being shrunk down stored in a capsule And on that note could you store a person animal in a capsule >>> dragon-ball

I got into a discussion with this with my brother the other day and I was wondering if this would be a valid way to cultivate and stock up on Sharingans We see that Madara Tobi had an entire laboratory of Sharingans presumably gathered from the corpses from the Uchiha Massacre Now if someone like Kabuto were to reanimate Uchiha they would be revived back with their own eyes as we saw with Itachi Then would it be possible to remove the reanimated Itachi s eyes and store them for use for a later date My brother told me that the problem with this theory is that a reanimated body using Kabuto s Endo Tensei would just have body parts that would turn to paper dust if detached from its body as we saw from many reanimations who lost their limbs in the war But what if Kabuto un did the Endo Tensei jutsu immediately proceeding taking out the eyes of Itachi Would the eyes still turn to paper dust or would they manifest in a physical form If so this would allow someone like Kabuto to infinitely cultivate Sharingans by continuously reanimating and un reanimating an Uchiha something that could be very powerful when comboed with Izanagi If the above is not possible with Kabuto s jutsu how about with Orochimaru s Endo Tensei the one he used to revive the First and Second Hogake against the Third Hokage in the first Naruto series If I recall Orochimaru s original Endo Tensei didn t make the bodies immortal or turn to paper >>> naruto

In Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru the organization that is responsible for doing things involving the god tree is called Taisha The official Crunchyroll subs don t translate this word but in Japanese it s written As far as I can tell this is a legal term meaning general pardon which is a type of pardon in Japanese law that applies to all people convicted of a particular crime or class of crimes as contrasted with tokusha special pardon which applies only to specific people This is a very strange name for an organization What is stranger still is that if you know Japanese and you had never seen the term written down you would probably think that it would be written as the homophone which means grand shrine which makes a lot more sense as the name of an organization What is the logic behind writing Taisha as general pardon I am aware of the theory suggesting that you can rearrange the strokes of Yuuna and get Taisha see image I do not think that the theory has any merit since it involves rearranging strokes in a way that does not respect the radicals involved >>> yuki-yuna-is-a-hero

It seems to me that no matter how you look at it the events of the Rebellion movie are impossible due to Madoka s wish Her wish speech can roughly be split into five distinct parts significant differences between Meguca s and Doki s translation marked I want to erase eliminate all witches before they are even born I will erase every single witch in every universe past and future with my own hands I don t care what you call it All those magical girls who held onto their hopes and fought against witches I don t want to see them cry them to cry I want them to remain smiling until the end I will destroy any rule or law that stands in my way I will rewrite them all This is my desire prayer my wish Now grant me this Incubator The pars in brackets are most likely not part of the actual wish as we later clearly see that magical girls are not constantly smiling not to mention that that would be a very weird wish to make for Madoka So only # # and # are the actual wish Now in Rebellion Kyubee apparently manages to create a barrier that shuts out Madoka and causes Homura to turn into a witch in her own world soul gem However this contradicts the wish as Madoka does not allow for any exceptions to be made Even if we were to argue that a barrier is not a rule and hence not subject to # even though the fact that Madoka is barred from entering would be a rule # has no limits whatsoever and should prevent Homura from turning into a witch Possibly we can grant that this may happen not through Madoka s own hands as we might say that Homura s world is not part of any universe and hence # does not apply but turning into a witch is still impossible her wish isn t I want to eliminate all witches outside of barriers before their are born after all Furthermore Homura splitting Madoka into Madoka and the Law of the Circle is another such impossibility # says that Madoka and not the Law of the Circle will not can will she herself has no choice in the matter anymore do it with her own hands provided it happens within a universe In fact you might argue that after the split the Law will not do it as it was Madoka the human who made the wish and so if Madoka the goddess and Madoka the human are no longer the same entity it s the latter who has to do it whether she lacks the power or memory to do so is once again irrelevant the universe would be changed so she can do it anyway Effectively the problem is the universal definition of her wish it has no limitations and several universal quantifiers and hence can not really be circumvented There are even further issues but they depend on how exactly you interpret the terms rule and universe >>> madoka-magica

In Garo Honoo no Kokuin we see that the golden armor Garo can only be passed down to one s lineal descendants for example from Anna s father to Leon and Alfonso What about the other armors like Zoro and Gaia though Do they have any restrictions on who can use them At minimum it looks like Gaia doesn t have any restrictions based on bloodline since Raphael was able to pass Gaia onto Alfonso and I don t see how Raphael could be a lineal ancestor of Alfonso Alfonso s father is the king i e not Raphael his maternal grandfather was the former Garo i e not Raphael and his paternal grandfather is presumably long dead given that his son the current king is now on the throne Answers based on the tokusatsu version are welcome if they make sense in the context of the anime >>> garo

Question I have noticed that in the Korean dub version of the Aria series the OP and ED songs are not only subtitled but are also sung in Korean How common is it to also dub the OP and ED songs of a not too popular series cf EVA Doraemon And does that require more licensing than just subtitling the OPs and EDs Question In the Korean dubbed OP of Aria the Animation why was the Katakana removed Does this kind of thing happen in other subbed dubbed anime OPs or EDs Original OP animation in the Chinese sub Altered art logo in the Korean dub Question What is it about the Korean dub version of Aria the Animation that requires a director and editing In contrast the Italian staff has a dubbing director a coordination a mixing a post production and a sound engineer Is any of these roles synonymous to the director or editing in the Korean staff >>> anime-production aria

When a Servant is summoned by the Holy Grail they are gifted with the knowledge of the modern world so they can easily adjust When it comes to determining the strengths and weaknesses of an enemy Servant the Servants themselves seem to be able to rely on a pool of data as shown during the prologue of Fate Stay Night when Rin and Archer face Lancer Archer reveals that he has deduced Lancer s true identity However during this same scene Lancer is frustrated because he doesn t know of any hero who was an Archer but also used twin swords given that we know that Archer is a future alternate version of Shirou who became the Counter Guardian EMIYA When a Servant is summoned are they also given the knowledge of the legends for heroes who appeared after that Servant s death i e Gilgamesh is probably the oldest legend and as such he predates most others and thus wouldn t know about other legends that occur after his death unless supplemented by the Grail >>> fate-stay-night
In Fate Stay Night in the nd Day of the Prologue Rin takes Archer to the Fuyuki Park where the th Holy Grail War ended While they are there Rin s Command Spell acts up and because Archer can t sense any Servant they figure out that another Master is spying on Rin Just using logic I could assume it s not Caster as while she is the Master of Assassin she is also a Servant and Archer sensed no Servants Bazett as Kotomine had told Rin that of the Masters are ready While it s revealed in Fate Hollow Ataraxia that she was Lancer s original Master at this point I could assume he had already attacked and stolen her Command Spells Shinji as the day before Rin didn t detect the Bounded Field at the school but the day after she does which means while she was away from school Shinji and or Rider would have been setting it up then Shirou as he wasn t a Master at that point So that would leave Ilya or Kotomine However I can t be sure if Sakura had created the Book of the False Attendant at this point or if Kotomine was actually doing his own recon so I am wondering if there is any source indicating which Master was spying on Rin and Archer at this point >>> fate-stay-night

This is a spoiler as it basically describes the last scene in the anime In the last scene of the final episode of Bokura Ga Ita ep Yano repeats a quote that Nanami made in an earlier episode The quote was it all equals out In the earlier episode where the quote originated Nanami was explaining to Yano how he may not have anyone he loves but there are people who really love him and thus shouldn t it all equal out Now back to the final scene He repeats the quote it all equals out and questions it He says it didn t all equal out and that it ended up more equal on the positive side I ve watched two different translations of the scene and I am still confused What exactly is the positive side I originally thought it was basically saying you love no one but someone loves you a lot so it equals out so I m not understanding the sides Did he simply just mean I loved no one Nanami loved me dearly and it ended up being on the side of me loving Nanami Or is there more to it Note that this isn t a question about how it ended This is a question about the literal meaning of the final lines in the anime I suspect it might be something lost in translation >>> japanese-language bokura-ga-ita

I just finished episode of EVA and I noticed that the last two previews I d seen looked a lot rougher The preview after episode consists of a series of what seem to be rough drawings or sketchs over a voiceover The preview after episode was animated in that there were some moving frames but looked unfinished the colouring and lining looks incomplete Moreover some of the images look like they come from a manga in terms of for instance speech bubbles or hiragana katakana given for some kanji although it seems possible to me that the bubbles might just have been taped on so as to give people involved in production some idea of the dialogue in each scene For example Comparatively the artwork in prior episode previews seemed somewhat more finished and at least in my memory was usually animated Why was there such a change in the quality content of the previews Perhaps this is related to the infamous issues with the production Are these just unfinished production material I haven t seen the last two episodes so I don t know if the preview material for episode is actual material that shows up in that episode but I definitely don t remember seeing any of the material that crops up in the preview for showing up there Also what are these speech bubbles that show up in the episode preview for episode actually for >>> anime-production neon-genesis-evangelion

The use of the Death Note in the human world sometimes affects other humans lives or shortens their original life span even though their names are not actually written in the Death Note itself In these cases no matter the cause the god of death sees only the original lifespan and not the shortened lifespan We saw that Misas lifespan was shortened because Light was killed by Ryuk So this means that you can shorten a persons lifespan with the death note So let s say A has a death note and knows that C wants to kill B with a death note He writes B s name in his death note thus preventing him from being killed by a death note So C can t kill B with a death note anymore But since the death note can shorten the lifespan of those whos name isn t written in the death note C decides to use Y to set up a trap C writes Y Car accident Dies at after he produces a deadly poison which he injects into the food the person he knows as B eats After he did this he will die days later in a car accident So could C shorten B s lifespan in this way so that he is able to indirectly kill him >>> death-note

While rewatching The Flowers of Evil I noticed this character in episode The character on the left struck me as very odd she s wearing braids which would normally suggest a female character but she also has sideburns which seem to be more or less only something men wear I m assuming the character is female from the voice actor who plays at that moment Moreover if the character weren t female it would be odd for a school to allow him to wear braids Reddit suggests that this character also appears in the manga so is this just intentional character design rather than an error in the art If so who is this character and is there anything e g personality traits that might explain this odd hairstyle I have not read the manga yet and so can t easily look this up Update I remembered seeing some video footage of the live action filming that the rotoscoped animation was apparently from on YouTube so I might try to dig that out to see if I can get a better idea of what s going on here On a second glance the braids struck me as a bit odd in terms of the shaping of their ends one usually expects the hair to thin out somewhat and possibly curve a bit so it occurred to me that this might be useful Update After reading the entire manga I couldn t find a character with identical design From the uniform notice that the character here wears a bow instead of a tie it seems certain that they re probably female However I did notice a presumably female character with very short hair for a girl that was in the corresponding chapater of the manga I don t remember if the character was wearing a female uniform but will look it up later when I have time >>> aku-no-hana

I m looking for an anime where the main character was on board a train on his way to school with whom appeared to be his younger sister apparently only he could see her where he met a girl on the train when another girl seemingly committed suicide by jumping in front of the train The problem was that the girl committing suicide was not dead The girl on board proceeded to get off the train then cast some strange spell and finished off the undead girl The boy s younger sister then told him that the girl was a witch I think all of this happened in the first episode There is another scene in this anime where a goth loli witch showed up and got picked up by some pervert She let him strip her at a hotel maybe Then she cast a spell leaving the man to be eaten by a swarm of insects from her nether regions The goth loli then transferred to the same school as the main character and the witch on the train The transferred witch went on a tour of the school with the main character The goth loli had a sadistic nature and enjoyed killing The first scene shows the main character near a body of water I can t quite remember if it was a river or the ocean with some type of golem forming in front of him but he wasn t scared This leads me to believe that he could use some form of magic and it might be the case that the little girl who accompanied him on the train wasn t a ghost but maybe something he created About the witch on board the train with them I think she wore glasses and she was just sitting there until the train stopped because a girl jumped in front of it At this point I vaguely remember some form of monologue from the main character about how people kill themselves by train and how he never paid too much attention to the witch on board with him After the girl who committed suicide was killed his invisible friend then stated that the girl on the train with them was a witch >>> identification-request

I remember very little detail of this movie that randomly aired on TV about a decade ago Here is what I do remember Dark overtones reminiscent of a future noir style Animation similarly is reminiscent of Ghost in the Shell or Ergo Proxy Paces slowly as further details are given about the monster Possibly produced in the late s to early s a few years before I watched it The focus of the movie is a rather generic monster it walks on all fours is adept at swimming has olive skin and a large tail Also at some point it is discovered that it s pregnant One of the main characters is a salty old detective who limps around I think he has a cane which he hastily abandons in a chase scene next bullet There is a climactic point in which the detective is limping through a multilevel construction site whilst being pursued by the monster There are large exo suits visible in the background possibly used for construction In this same scene the construction site undergoes some sort of emergency shutdown during which the monster s large tail is cut off by a closing door I m not certain but I believe the monster dies in the end I m sorry I don t remember anymore details than that >>> identification-request

I ve watched it a long time ago so I don t really remember much and I m not sure if I accidentally mixed two anime together or not I remember that there was this scientist who took his wife and made her into a baby again but she lost all her memories of him The scientist did the same thing to himself but with the help of his assistant The assistant was taken under the scientist s wing when he was very young so the assistant saw the scientist as a father really I think the assistant had light brown hair and I know he had mismatched eyes The main character is the scientist s wife I also know that she had memories of her husband but thought they were just memories of her parents She also had a picture of them both before they were turned into babies The thing is that I think the scientist put a picture of them both in the basket The basket was where she was kept as a baby She was brought to an orphanage So the storyline of what I remember was her trying to find her parents meeting up with her husband again but not remembering him They ended up falling in love again This is the part where I m not sure if its from the same anime but I think during the process of being turned into a baby the wife was split into two Her other half was completely different from her tho So while growing up the two girls lived different lives I think the other half was really weak so the friends she made wanted to protect her The only way to do that was fight I also think magical rings were involved Damn I d actually be impressed if someone gets this I d be so greatful This anime has been in the back of my head forever and I wanna rewatch it Thank you for reading this tho >>> identification-request

I apologize in advance for the lack of details This is an anime movie which I ve watched a long time ago on TV and I ve only seen the ending I remember a scene in which there was a man and woman talking and one of them betrayed the other and shot them The animation style resembles something from the Lensman era so I m thinking s or early s I distinctively remember it due to the fact that it was one of the first animations if not movies in general that had important non villain characters dying Anyway the one detail I distinctively remember is that every time a person died it was depicted as a white bird flying away as if the person s soul was going to heaven At the end there was a guy lying down leaning on a rock apparently dying possibly regretting something he had done or a choice he made He was looking at the sky and then you see a white bird flying away implying he had died The bird then joined a whole bunch of other white birds implying something about his choice having caused a lot of people to die or something to that extent It was all very symbolic but I was young and started watching it near the end so I could only just barely follow I also think it was possibly sci fi but not sure Anyway while I realize it s a long shot I would like to know if anyone has a clue what movie it was so maybe I can watch it again from the start and actually get it this time >>> identification-request

It s an older manga and it is completed Can t remember the name but it kind of reminded me of Ao no Exorcist the only major difference though is that there were no exorcists I believe it begins with a kid and his brother the brother became a cop to catch their parents killer The one brother does his own kind of investigation into some murders and eventually intersects with his cop brother and I believe the cop bro dies while the other brother gains a portion of the killers powers Because of the powers he gains the ability to see demons and other supernatural phenomenon The surviving brother eventually becomes a cop and investigates all sorts of supernatural stuff One case had something to do with a magical pelt that when worn allows the person to become a werewolf Another case had something to do with goblins tearing things apart because they weren t being paid their due In order for the Goblins to be useful or helpful had to leave out some kind of candy or they would destroy stuff Some additional info it is set in Europe and his power had something to do with a spear I think it was the Spear of Longinus >>> identification-request

More details The main character preferred fighting unarmed or with very short weapons feeling that any long weapon could be countered by getting in close This fighting style is unique to his clan whose name begins with an M yes I m sure of that The main character s final fight was with another good guy whose skill was on par with his own This other good guy carried both a katana and a wakizashi slightly shorter sword and in one case used one of them as a throwing weapon The other good guy wore a blue kimono The genre is both historically inspired but slightly shonen ized I think these details combined are unique to this particular anime Looking for the name but also an opportunity to re watch Any helpful links are also appreciated I ll keep adding details as I remember them until someone correctly names it Update As Dario guessed it was Shura no Toki I highly recommend this one because of its similarity to certain historical characters and events >>> identification-request

I ve searched everywhere to no avail I m looking for a movie or TV series from the s or early s I remember a scene where a man was lying on the ground collapsed and weak possibly in the middle of a fight battle He then reached for a star or gem or crystal which he placed on his forehead to transform into a hero with armor or some kind of light mecha suit After the transformation the star remained on his forehead and glimmered Then he was able to continue the battle or whatever he was doing >>> identification-request

So I finally got around to seeing what the fuss was all about with Attack on Titan anime series by marathoning it in two days and I am glad I did Do note that I just finish watching the anime series only so if it s answered in the manga please indicate spoilers The thing that stood out for me though was the complete absence of Eren s father after the first two episodes and the fact that no one seemed in the least bit concerned We know he was probably not dead because in the second episode he was seen riding back home concerned about whether his wife Eren and Mikasa were safe In Eren s memories he also seemed to be aware of what was going to happen or saw it as inevitable so it seemed unlikely that he had been killed particularly with no mention of it However aside from some recurrences of Eren s dream memory there was no sign of his father at all and nobody seemed to care Eren and Mikasa didn t mention or even recognised the absence And the various soldiers generals etc didn t seem interested either even though Eren made it clear that his father had something hidden in his basement possibly related to his ability I would have thought that someone would have interrogated him further on what his father was doing or what could be in the basement All we seem to know is that he had been traveling somewhere for a week or so Is there an explanation as to where Dr Jaeger was during the years Is it just an oversight that Eren s father is so glossed over by the series Seems kind of weird when he s potentially a crucial character in the same vein as Annie s father >>> shingeki-no-kyojin
In Episode of Puella Magi Madoka Magica during Madoka s conversation with Kyuubei we see that she has a ton of chairs in her room At first I thought this was just the usual Shaft weirdness But I stumbled on a blog post that attempted to explain all the symbolism behind the imagery in this scene According to the author of the blog the empty chairs represent fallen Magical Girls While the author s interpretation is plausible I also found it somewhat tenuous mdash the only evidence the author gives is the scene in Mami s apartment earlier on when Madoka sees Mami s furniture and bursts into tears I don t have a very clear memory of the scene but I don t remember it focusing specifically on the furniture mdash it could just as well have been the empty apartment Is there any other evidence in the show that supports this blogger s reading And is there evidence that supports another meaning for the scores of empty chairs in Madoka s room >>> madoka-magica symbolism
Hi it s a manga i began to read a few years ago and i can t remember the title if you could help me The two main characters are taking an exam to become some sort of artifact users they go there in a flying bus They were raised by a sect that teach them how to use a crack in their head for power something about greed There was also some story about gods like behemoth If you know what this manga is i ll be sooo thankful it has been keeping me awake for too long >>> identification-request
